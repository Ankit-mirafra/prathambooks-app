New London, Connecticut, United States. 7 am. Kids were tumbling out of bed, their mothers hurrying them to clean their teeth, handing them tooth sticks and jars of toothpaste. What? Did I just say Toothsticks? Thats right. They used toothsticks to clean their teeth back in 1870. A toothstick was simply a twig with a frayed end. Some lucky kids had twigs with boar hair tied to one end for that extra shine. And what was that other thing I said? Jars of toothpaste? Thats right. Toothpaste tubes were not invented yet. They only had jars. And every bleary eyed kid started her day by dipping a toothstick into a porcelain jar filled with toothpaste. Actually, into the same porcelain jar that every other member of the family dipped their toothstick into. Including that visiting grand aunt with yellow and black teeth, whose toothstick matched her teeth. One morning, a disgusted cry went up in a dentists house. Ewwwwwwwwww! It was Dr. Sheffields son Lucius, who refused to dip into the jar anymore and decided to use tooth powder henceforth. But a thought remained in his mind there must be a better way to use toothpaste. A few years later, Lucius went to Paris to study the science of dentistry. There, he saw artists squeezing paint from metal tubes on to their paintbrushes. Why couldn't the same type of tube be used to hold toothpaste?! He rushed back home and shared this idea with his father, who thought that it was just totally awesome. There was just that little matter of figuring out how to get the toothpaste from a jar into the tube through that little opening. How do you think Lucius could fill toothpaste into an empty tube? Have you had a bad morning when you squeezed way too much paste in your half asleep state? And you see that theres toothpaste all over the sink and your mother is reminding you that the school bus will be at the doorstep in twenty minutes, and the last thing you want is for her to flip when she sees the mess youve made? How would you go about putting the toothpaste back into the tube? Now, what do you think Lucius and his father used to fill a tube with toothpaste? A ear bud? Or a really tiny spoon? A toothpick? It was not as messy as youd expect, because the way Dr. Sheffield and his team did it was without opening the cap! Thats right, they kept the cap screwed on tight, and opened up the other end! Its definitely easier to fill a tube from the larger end, especially if you have something to pump the paste with, like a syringe. After that, all you have to do is seal the end tight so that the paste will not leak. Today, toothpaste tubes are filled using machines. All the empty tubes are lined up on a conveyer belt with their caps downwards and the unsealed end pointing up. A big container filled with toothpaste is fixed above the conveyor belt. From a nozzle at the bottom of the container, the toothpaste is let into each of these tubes as they move along the conveyor belt. But the paste is not filled all the way to the brim. About half an inch is left so that it can be sealed. Now the tube is ready to be squeezed! Ancient Indian wisdom for good teeth Many people in India use datun, the twig of a neem or babool tree, instead of a factory-made brush. Datun keeps teeth and gums healthy. But do you know which the best brush in the world is? Your fingers, say dentists! Great for the teeth and gums. Have you tried tooth powder? What are the different smells that you can detect in it? Herbs and spices that are good for teeth include mint, clove, cinnamon, black pepper and tulsi. Eating fibrous fruits and vegetables, like apples and carrots, is good for cleaning teeth.

Is it a code word used by bees to call their friends? Or a hum of excitement when honey is spotted? Bees, particularly bumble bees, make a loud buzzing sound as they fly. The sound is made when the wings beat up and down. The smaller the wings, the faster the bees have to beat them in order to fly. And the quicker they beat, the louder the buzz. Bees also buzz to do something very useful; they carry pollen from one flower to the other like a postman delivering letters. Pollen is the powdery grain on flowers. Pollen helps plants to make seeds. Bees are excellent pollinators. Thanks to them, many new plants grow and sprout all around. How do those tiny grains of pollen stick to the bees' feet? When bees sit on a flower to suck honey, the grains of pollen stick to their feet and bodies. Then when the same bees buzz near a flower and perform a lively dance, the quivering shakes the pollen off on other flowers. The bees then fly to other flowers where they leave the pollen behind to pick up new ones and this process continues. Bees are the buzzing godfathers of many new plants that grow away from the parent-tree. Can you hear your own breath? Usually not. But you can hear a bee breathing.That is because the buzz is also the sound of the bee breathing. It has a small, segmented body so when it breathes, the air gets on a roller coaster ride through all those bumpy parts inside and creates a buzz. Sounds pretty exciting, doesnt it? Arent those busy bees truly amazing? DID YOU KNOW? 1. Bees are hard workers. In winter, they can live up to nine months and in summer only up to two months. All work and no play does not make them dull. 2. A curious case of the bees is that when they do the work of a younger bee, their brain stops ageing. It starts working like a younger bees brain. Do you now wish you were a bee? 3. Bees recognize faces just like human beings do. Each part of the face is first taken separately, then put together to make up the face. Remember not to anger a bee! 4. Caffeine, a chemical used by plants to keep away harmful insects, helps bees remember the location of the flower. It welcomes the bees for a second visit. 5. Bumble bees are larger than honey bees and other types of bees. They live in hives and love to socialise. Many bumble bees do not have a sting. They may not produce much honey but are excellent pollinators. Be a bee! 1. A honey bee performs a dance that tells the rest of the hive where to find nectar. Now try to express some information through dance moves, and see if your friends are able to understand what you are communicating! 2. Try buzzing like a bee... flap your arms and see if you can hear a buzz. 3. A honeycomb, the house of the bees, is known to be a masterpiece of engineering. Why do you think? Try and draw perfect hexagons as in a honeycomb. Or make models using ordinary cartons. Maybe youll guess the answer then! 4. Try to carefully smell different flowers. You could then imagine how honey made from the nectar of different flowers can also taste different.""}"
"{'Title': 'Why Does A Poori Puff Up?', 'Category': 'STEM,Series,Non-fiction', 'Labels': ['children', 'science', 'education', 'curiosity', 'experimentation', 'learning', 'girl protagonist', 'boy protagonist', 'parental guidance', 'scientific explanation'], 'Read Level': 'Level 3', 'Author': 'Varsha  Joshi', 'Hyperlink': 'https://storyweaver.org.in/stories/3841', 'Story': ""Aditi and Aarav love pooris. Halwa- poori, kheer-poori and shreekhand poori. Yummy! Chhole-poori or aaloo-poori. finger-licking good! Pooris are tasty, whatever you may eat them with! The smell of pooris frying! Oh, so wonderful. The sight of pooris swimming in hot oil! One look at golden, crispy, hot, puffed pooris and Aditi and Aarav rush to get the roundest and the most puffed ones. But how does the poori puff? Is there air inside? Who fills the poori with air? Aditi and Aarav blow air into balloons,to make them puff up. Pa uses a pump to fill air in the tyre of his bicycle. But Ma doesnt seem to use any of these methods to puff the poori. She just fries them and they puff. Amazing! Aditi and Aarav decide to observe, ask questions and find answers the next time pooris are made at home. Pa has put some whole-wheat flour in a big dish. He adds a little oil and some salt and starts mixing water into the flour. How come the flour is absorbing the water readily? Well, the reason is, something in the wheat flour is very thirsty! When you are thirsty what do you do? You drink water. Gliadin and Glutenin are the two types of proteins in the wheat. Proteins and all other chemical substances are made up of tiny units called molecules. The molecules in these proteins are very thirsty. As soon as water is put in the flour, these molecules drink it. Then they become big and fat. They expand. Naturally, they dont have enough space to sit comfortably. So they touch and push each other. They actually stick to each other. Sometimes, you hold each others hand and make a chain while playing. The whole chain then moves about. Similarly, these molecules stick together and form a network. Pa has made dough out of the flour. He asks Ma to knead the dough some more. She smears some oil on her palm and starts kneading. You need strong hands to knead the dough. She says if the dough is not kneaded the pooris wont puff. How are these two related? Here is the secret. When you knead the dough, the molecules that are stuck to each other, now start stretching. When this stretching is complete, a new protein is formed. It is called Gluten. Gluten is elastic like a rubber band and we can give any shape to that dough. Ma has left the dough aside for some time. She is now preparing the kheer. Aditi and Aarav decide to come back when she starts rolling the pooris. Now Ma and Pa are ready. Ma has poured oil in the frying pan and has put it on the stove. She pinches off a small amount of dough, and rolls it into a poori. Pa slides the poori into the hot oil. In minutes, the poori has puffed. How did that happen? Here is what happens to the poori. The rolling is possible due to the Gluten in the dough. When the small piece of dough is rolled, a Gluten sheet is formed in the poori. When the poori is put in the hot oil, its lower surface becomes very hot due to the oil. Do you remember that water was used for making the dough? So, due to the high temperature, the water in the poori turns into steam. This steam is very powerful and it lifts up the sheet of Gluten. And that is why the poori puffs. Pa now turns the poori so that the other surface also turns golden. He has taken the poori out of the pan and kept it in a dish. Now with the help of a fork let us make a hole in a poori. See the steam oozing out? So the puffed poori doesnt contain air. It has steam in it, right? Why are the pooris used for bhel-poori, aloodahi-poori not puffed? There could be three reasons: if the poori is rolled very thin the steam formed is not sufficient for the pressure to build up so that the poori can puff . Sometimes after the pooris are rolled, thin holes are made in them with a fork so that while frying, whatever steam is created, it comes out of the holes and does not let the poori puff. Such flat pooris can be used for longer. Also if pooris are fried at low temperatures, steam forms very slowly, pressure does not build up and the poori does not puff. Now you know why some pooris puff up, and why some pooris don't! Experiment to get gluten from wheat flour Make dough using wheat flour and water. Use only adequate amount of water so that the dough would not be too hard or too soft. Use the lower portion of the palm and knead the dough for few minutes. If necessary, little oil can be used so that the dough does not stick to your palm. Leave the dough covered for about ten minutes. Now take a big bowl and put the dough in it after kneading it for few minutes again. Pour water on the dough in the bowl so that it is completely immersed in water. Continue kneading the dough in water till the water becomes white. Throw the water out and put fresh water in the bowl. Repeat the procedure till you observe that a small portion of the dough now remains which when kneaded water does not turn white. This means all the starch from the dough is removed and only gluten has remained. This is because starch dissolves in water but gluten does not. Take out the small portion of the dough which is gluten. You can stretch it like a rubber band. If you stretch it and leave it comes back to original state. This demonstrates the elasticity in it. You can spread it horizontally. This demonstrates the plasticity in it. Poori facts from history According to scientists, wild wheat originated first in middle east countries about 11,000 years ago. According to the worlds first encyclopedia Abhilashitarth chintamani or Manasollas written in 12th century by King Someshwar, something similar to poori was made at that time but was called as pahalika. So poori is at least 800 years old. Excavation done near Damaskas in Syria revealed wheat dated back 9000 years. Tools necessary for planting and harvesting wheat plants and also for grinding wheat were found at the same sight. CAN YOU FIND OUT? Can pooris be made from jowar, bajra or rice flour? Why? Apart from pooris, what are the other things we make using wheat flour? What happens if you put too much water in the flour? What happens when you use other methods of cooking flour such as in a tandoor or on a tawa?""}"

Theyre bright and twinkling like little stars! I wish I could have glowed like them but I cant! Can anyone tell me why? Imagine a dark, moonless night when you have gone camping with your classmates and you lose your way. What would you do? Will you not try contacting your friends by flashing your torchlight? Well, fireflies or lightning bugs as they are sometimes called do the same, except that they have an unlimited supply of light within themselves! That is why fireflies never worry about fused light bulbs or electricity tariffs. They seem immensely happy just flying around and glowing- this is their signal to say, Hey, look! Im here! The glow of the firefly is produced by a protein called luciferase and a pigment called luciferin. Proteins are special food used by our bodies to create muscles, bones and skin while pigments are natural colouring substances found in plants and animals. When these two meet inside the tiny belly of the firefly, they react with the oxygen already found in there. A celebration takes place, a soft firework display, so to say and bright light is produced which is the glow of the firefly! Fireflies therefore are bio-luminescent but they are not the only ones. Different types of fish and marine creatures in the sea also produce their own lights! The glow of the firefly functions like a light switch and is periodically turned on and off by the insect. It does this by sending a special message from its brain to the light organ inside its body that is its abdomen and soon the chemical reaction begins and the glow is produced! The grown up fireflies use their glow to call out to their mates. In fact, female fireflies prefer flashy males that can blink the longest or at a faster pace. Once they see this special glow, the females respond to it by switching on their own lights. The firefly-mates soon meet and baby fireflies get created! The younger fireflies or the larvae, unlike their parents, use their glow mainly to chase predators away. The chemicals within their bodies are toxic and have a horrible taste so creatures that come to feast on them get put off and go hunting elsewhere for tastier munchies! Fireflies are never actually alone! There are more than 2,000 species of fireflies on this earth. During springtime, especially on dark nights, you may spot a few of them flitting around brightly! Fireflies maybe tiny, smaller than your fingers perhaps, but grouped together, these glowing insects can light up an entire garden and all for free! Sounds incredible, doesnt it? Amazing facts about fireflies 1. Fireflies are not flies but beetles! They are often called lightning bugs but they arent bugs either. 2. Different species of fireflies glow in different colors that range from yellow to green. Fireflies that flit around in the dark emit a greenish glow while those found outdoors during twilight give out a yellowish light. 3. There are a few non-vegetarian fireflies that feed on mites and other fireflies! 4. Adult fireflies arent the only ones that glow, their eggs and larvae glow as well! If you tap a fireflys egg, it flashes in response to your touch. 5. Fireflies live in all continents except Antarctica. They love tropical climate but also thrive in temperate zones. They flit around forests, meadows and gardens during summer everywhere except in Antarctica that is much too cold for them. Do It Yourself 1. Find out what else glows in the dark. Both, living and non-living. 2. While playing in a group, imagine yourselves as fireflies. Carry a small torch in your hand and make different formations like fireflies. 3. Make a firefly with trash. For example, with a plastic bottle and glow stick. You can also try your own special ideas.'}"

One day, during science class, she looked out of the window and saw an eagle gliding in the sky. How happy the bird must be! She also liked to see planes flying. Here, what's your name? Should you not be looking at the board? asked the new teacher in Sarla's class. Sarla got up hastily and said, Sorry Madam, I was watching an eagle. I wish we could fly like a bird, or like an aeroplane.... What is your name? Sarla. Oh how nice! Do you know that Sarla was the name of the first Indian woman pilot too? My name, Hamsa, means a swan. Swans are one of the largest flying birds, you know, said the teacher. You must spend some time in the library, Sarla. I'm sure there are many books about birds and flights, and machines that fly like aeroplanes. Over the next few days, Sarla happily learnt a lot about birds, and about aeroplanes. Sarla learnt that human beings can fly too, but not like birds. We can fly to any city in the world in an aeroplane, one of mankinds greatest inventions. With the help of this great machine, we can also experience the joy of being airborne. Birds are aerial creatures that do not need an external machine to fly. Usually, a bird's wings are bigger than the rest of its body. The wings are very light, making it possible for birds to fly. Aeroplanes are huge and very heavy. Just like birds, aeroplanes have wings on both their sides which help them to fly. The wings of the plane are shaped just like those of birds - curved on the top and flat on the bottom which helps them to fly high up in the sky. Birds flap their wings to fly, but of course we have never seen an aeroplane flapping its wings! Birds flap their wings as they use the wind to push their body upwards. Aeroplanes also fly with the help of the force of the wind. This machine uses the engine inside its body to create wind that flows below the plane. An engine is a very strong machine which acts like the brain of the plane. Just like a bird uses its mind and logic to navigate its flight, engines help planes to push them above the ground and to help them move forward. When the planes engines burn fuel, they release hot gases at high speeds which push on the air behind the engine, moving the plane forward. Cars and other vehicles with engines move forward too. But they cannot go up in the sky like planes. The wind flows over and under their wings which are shaped like birds wings and lifts the plane into the sky and keeps it there. Planes also have tails, just like birds, to keep them steady and help them change direction. Planes need big long roads to take off and land. These long roads are called runways and planes need to travel very fast on the runway before they can take off into the air. Planes need to gain a lot of speed to lift off in the air. Most aeroplanes can take off only if they are moving fast enough. The runway is an important part of the airport as it gives aeroplanes enough time to increase their speed and ultimately take off. Planes know where they have to go because they are steered by pilots. The pilots control the plane from a place in the front of the aeroplane called the cockpit. They keep in contact with the airport (a place from where the planes take off and land) through very accurate and modern devices. Just like there are signals and police to help us on the roads, there are air traffic controllers who tell pilots when and where to fly; and when it is safe to take off or land. A plane is actually a giant bird. It is not only shaped like a bird, it also allows us to fly, though not like birds! Sarla wants to be a pilot and fly aeroplanes when she grows up. Did You Know? Indias first aircraft was the Harlow which first flew in July 1941. The first pilot license in India was awarded to JRD Tata in February 1929 by the Aero Club of India and Burma. The fastest jet aircraft in the world is the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird which flies at a speed faster than the speed of sound. Sarla Thakral was the first Indian woman to fly an aircraft. She was also the first woman pilot to accumulate over 1000 hours of flying. Let's take off! Have fun with friends with these activities: 1. Make paper planes and see whose plane goes the farthest. Is it the paper or the way it has been made that makes a paper plane go faster? Observe what happens when each plane is launched. Is there a difference if you blow over, or into or under the plane before you shoot it off? 2. Fly-Don't fly Game: Get a group of friends to 'fly' around the room, without touching each other. The den stands in a corner and calls out the names of flying or non-flying objects. When a non-flying object (like table) is called, the 'planes' must 'land' (sit down). Whoever makes a mistake is the next den.""}"

Smooth pebbles from the riverside, twirly and tickly fern leaves, bright red buttons that have fallen from a school uniform Tooka and Poi pick them all up. Every day, they meet after school, near the bendy coconut tree by the river, and wait for their best friend. At five o clock on the dot, Inji arrives, huffing and puffing like an old school bus. Inji is a friendly dog with eyes the colour of chocolate and a tail that never stops wagging. Together, Tooka, Poi, and Inji walk, heads bent, scanning the gleaming road, the tufts of grass, and moss-covered rocks for interesting things to collect. Their favourite thing to collect are seeds! Tooka and Poi collect shiny red seeds that look like ladybirds, spiky burrs that stick to their clothes, and the giant bean-shaped pods of the copper pod tree. The pods make a delightful tshh-tsh-tshh sound when Tooka and Poi shake it about. Poi loves to make up funny songs to go with the seed music. Inji is the best of dogs, She likes big flowers and little frogs, And birds and seeds and ants and snails, But best of all, she loves her tail! Over and over she sings these songs, making Tooka laugh and Inji bark happily. Tooka, Poi, and Inji are sitting by the tamarind tree. Tookas favourite seeds are the pudgy pods from around this tree. He loves to suck on its sour flesh until he gets to the shiny brown seeds inside. It makes Tookas face scrunch up in funny ways and the hair on the back of his neck stands up. Suddenly they hear a small squeaky voice say Hellllooooo."" Tooka and Poi look at each other, puzzled. They cant see anybody. Up here! Up here! they hear the voice say again. Tooka and Poi look up and down, and all around, but there isnt a person in sight. Its me, Pacha. Im the tamarind tree. Inji barks loudly and wags her tail faster than normal. Phat-phat-phat it goes, back and forth. Why hello Inji, Pacha the Tree says. I havent seen you in days! Tooka and Poi become still as statues. Their eyes widen and their mouths freeze in big \'O\' shapes. Finally, Poi smiles shyly and says, Hello Pacha the Tamarind Tree. Its nice to meet you. Im Poi! Then she gives the tree a big hug. Pacha giggles, Ive never been hugged by a little girl before! It feels tickly! And weve never met a talking tree before! Tooka says, cheerfully, So this is an adventure for all of us. Hearing this, Pacha laughs loudly, making the leaves on his branches glow a brighter green. What are you two up to today? Pacha asks. Were collecting things! Tooka and Poi say! Tooka and Poi show Pacha the Tree their bag of flowers, pebbles, and sticky tamarind. How lovely that youre collecting seeds! Pacha says. Do you know I came from one of those little tamarind seeds? And look at me now, all grown up with so many branches and a big family of sparrows and squirrels and crows living with me. What do you mean? Tooka asks. Inji barks enthusiastically. Bow! Bow! Bow! Inji said but Tooka is sure it sounds like How? How? How? Those seeds youre collecting, Pacha explains, Theyre all tree babies. They are? Poi asks, her eyebrows scrunched into squiggly black lines. Do all seeds grow into tamarind trees? Poi asks, trying to remember how many seeds she has at home. Oh no! Pacha replies. Seeds grow into all sorts of things. Do you have any fruit in your bag? Pacha asks. Tooka nods and pulls out a small, red apple and a soggy banana. There you go! Pacha says, excitedly. Now bite into the apple until you reach the centre. Youll see little brown seeds sitting there. Theyre like shiny little bugs! says Poi. Arent they pretty? Pacha asks. Those little seeds grow into apple trees Now break the banana in half and see what you find, Pacha instructs. I see the seeds! Tooka says excitedly. They look like a sleeping millipede! Seeds come in all shapes and sizes, Pacha says while Inji gobbles the last of the apple. Are they all tree babies? Poi asks. Yes! says Pacha. And they all have a little plant inside, waiting to come out and see the world. As Tooka, Poi, and Inji walk home that evening, they look closely at all the trees along the road. How pretty the leaves of the coconut tree look as they dance in the wind. How beautiful the red gulmohar flowers are against the bright blue sky. How nice and rough the bark of the mango tree feels under their palms. And how wonderful that something as big and important as a tree starts out as a teeny, weeny little seed. Tooka, Poi, and Inji still meet every evening after school. But now, Tooka and Poi collect things in which they can plant the seeds they collect. Old shoes, empty coconut shells, even used plastic bottles everything can be turned into pots. And every once in a while, they stop by for a chat with Pacha the Tree. Pachas Super Seed Guide Hello! Im Pacha, the tamarind tree, but I go by all sorts of names. Im called imli in Hindi, puli in Tamil, and tentul in Bengali. Scientists call me Tamarindus indica. Let me introduce you to some of my seed friends. You may have seen them on your dinner plate. Molagu Common name: Red chilli Scientists call me: Capsicum annum Chillies come in all shapes, sizes, and colours, and are grown all over the world. Its seeds are small, circular, and flat, and add spice to dal and bhaji . Careful when you touch them, they\'ll make your fingers burn! Kaapi Common name: Coffee Scientists call me: Coffeea Arabica You know the coffee your parents drink every morning? That comes from coffee berries. The seeds from the berries are dried, roasted, and then powdered. Coffee bushes grow best in hilly regions of South India. Chakka Common name : Jackfruit Scientists call me: Artocarpus heterophyllus Berries, apples, bananas, watermelon, and jackfruit all fruits have seeds in them. Some seeds we cannot eat, like that of the mango. Others, like the jackfruit, are used to make curries after they are soaked in water. Thenga Common name: Coconut Scientists call me: Cocos Nucifera Nearly every part of the hard, brown coconut is useful to us. The hairy, hard outside part is used to make rope, the fleshy inside is used in food, and the coconut water is a delicious drink, especially when its hot outside. And the oil that you put in your hair? That comes from the coconut too . Kappalandi Common name: Peanut Scientists call me: Arachis hypogaea All plants love soil, but peanuts love the earth so much that they grow underground. And thats why some people call them groundnuts. These little seeds are packed with goodness and are delicious when eaten raw, steamed, or roasted. Choru Common name: Rice Scientists call me: Oryza sativa Rice is one of the most popular grains! Its eaten in more homes in India than any other seed I know. On the plant, rice actually has a rough, brown cover, like a jacket, which keeps the seed inside safe and sound. Chocolate Common name: Chocolate Scientists call me: Theobroma cacao (which means food of the gods) Rice might be the most popular seed, but cacao is definitely the most loved seed of all especially by Tooka and Poi. The cacao seed is where chocolate comes from. Each cacao fruit has about 30-50 seeds that are roasted and then mixed with sugar and milk to make bars of delightful chocolate.'}"

It is a rather unusual ladder. In this ladder, the distance between the rungs gets bigger and BIGGER and BIGGER as you climb up the steps, growing 10 times at each step. Sometimes we will climb one step at a time and at other times we will skip many steps at one go. The funny thing is that we are not even sure which the last step is or whether the steps go on forever. Let the exciting journey begin! Step 0: 1 metre What do a five year old boy, a cricket bat and a newborn baby elephant have in common? All of them have a height of about 1 metre (or 1m for short)! It would be awkward to say that the ceiling of a room is 3 baby elephants high. So we make the sensible choice of saying that the height of the ceiling is 3 metres. Step 1: 10 metres Now that you have a feel for the size of one metre, we are ready to climb to the next step of our ladder, at 10 metres. A three storey building or a mango tree is roughly 10 metres high. A cricket pitch is about twice that length. Can you think of other objects that are about 10 m long or high? Step 2: 100 metres Have you noticed that with every step we add a zero to the right of the number we had before and the step number matches the number of zeroes? Keep track of that as we climb along. If you have run the 100m race on school sports day, or watched sprinters do it on TV, you know exactly how far that is. Now imagine if the 100m track stood up! That would be about the height of two Gol Gumbaz-es. The Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur, Karnataka, is the tomb of Mohammed Adil Shah. When it was built in 1656, it had the largest dome in the world. It held the record until 1881! Step 3: 1000 metres Thousand metres has a special name - it is called 1 kilometre or 1 km. You would cover this distance if you ran the 100 metre race 10 times - phew! You would need to climb about 9 km to reach the top of Mount Everest. Step 6: 10,00,000 metres Now let's skip 2 steps and go to step 6, which has six zeroes to the right of 1. The distance from the northern tip of India in Kashmir to the southern tip at Kanyakumari is about 4 times this distance, or 4 times 10,00,000 m, or 40,00,000 m. Because 40,00,000 m is quite a mouthful, we usually say 4000 km, which is the same thing. Step 8: 10,00,00,000 metres How far away is the bright, beautiful moon? It is right there on the 8th step of our distance ladder at about 4 times 10,00,00,000 m, or 4,00,000 km away from the earth! Step 11: 1,00,00,00,00,000 metres Let us skip two more steps and race to the blazing hot Sun. How far away is it? It is about 10,00,00,000 km PLUS another 5,00,00,000 km. That is very, VERY far away indeed! But the far, far away sun still lights up the world and makes us sweat in summer. Amazing, isn't it? Last Step??? Is there a last step on the ladder? We dont know yet! But with powerful telescopes, scientists have been able to see way beyond the sun. The farthest object that they have been able to spot is on the 26th step, 10,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 m away! That is SERIOUSLY FAR! Maybe when you grow up, you can discover something even further away, on the 28th or 29th step. Isnt that an exciting thought? Fun with Measuring The following activity done in a classroom setting is a great way to give children a feel for large distances and can engage the children either in a single group, or in teams. 1. Ask the children to cut long strips (each about an inch wide) from old newspapers. 2. Ask them to stick the strips end to end with tape or glue to make longer strips, until they get a strip that is 1 metre long (they can use a measuring tape for this). 3. Now ask the children to use this 1 m long strip as a measure and make 10 similar strips and stick them end to end to make a 10 m long strip. They can lie down next to this strip, head to head and feet to feet, and see how many of them it takes to make 10 m. 4. They can then stick ten 10 m strips together to make a 100 m strip that goes round the classroom many times. 5. What about a 1 km strip? How many times does that go around the classroom? Which team was able to create a 1 km long strip fastest? Notes for Parents Teachers: - When writing down big numbers with lots of zeroes after the 1, it is very easy for children - and adults! - to make mistakes. That is why the 'Powers of 10' notation is such a useful thing. Through this book, children can be taught how to use it - all they need to do is to count the number of zeroes to the right of the 1, and write that number as a superscript of 10. For instance, 1000, which has 3 zeroes after the 1, can be written as 10 3 . And 10000000 (7 zeroes after the 1), can be compactly written as 10 7 . Simple! - In this book, we stopped our 'How far is far?' game at the Sun. If you want to take the game further, you may want to bring in the nearest star beyond the Sun, Proxima Centauri, which is 10 16 m away from the Sun. Or the distance from one end of the Milky Way to another, which is 1,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 (or 10 21 ) m! - One thing you should know is that the distances that are given in the book are approximate, not exactly accurate. For example, 3984 km is given as 4000 km. This is not 'unscientific'. Rough estimates are very useful in science! Maybe you can do an activity with the kids to emphasize this. Is the length of a pencil closer to 10 1 cm or 10 2 cms? Is the weight of the school bus closer to 10 3 kgs or 10 4 kgs? Let the children come up with their own questions for their classmates too.""}"

But Reeti isnt happy. She doesnt like holidays. She likes going to school! In school Reeti has lots of friends. At home she has no one to play with. She has a Papa who brings her toys and books and tells her stories. Reeti likes that. Her Papa does yoga every morning. Reeti likes that too and tries to imitate him. She has a Mummy who writes poetry and works on a computer. Reeti likes looking at the computer with Mummy. She also likes looking at Mummys tummy! Mummys tummy is getting big and round. Because there is a baby in it. Soon youll have a little brother or sister to play with, says Mummy. Reeti likes that. But right now, she has no one to play with. Not one of her friends lives close by. Then one evening the doorbell rings. Their neighbour Das Uncle is standing outside holding a bright-green parrot in a black cage. We are leaving town, says Das Uncle. Would you like to have our Mithu as a pet? He can talk! Papa and Mummy look at each other. They dont think birds should be in cages. But Reeti is very excited. Yes, Uncle! she says, with a big smile. And so Mithu becomes Reetis new friend. Hello Mithu! says Reeti. Mithu looks at her. Hello! he says. Hello! Reeti is thrilled. Whats your name? she asks. Hello, says the parrot. No, says Reeti. Your name is Mithu. Say Mithu. Hello, says Mithu. No! No! says Reeti, shaking her head. Lets try again. My name is Reeti. Mithu, listen carefully. My name is Reeti. What is my name? Hello, says Mithu. NO! Reeti laughs. Mithu, you are a naughty boy! Every day Reeti tries to teach Mithu new words. Say Pa-pa. Say Mum-my. Say Ree-ti.

Just then Papa walks in, with Mithu in his cage. Hello! says Mithu. I took your friend to the park for some fresh air, says Papa. Reeti is so relieved! She gives Mithu the birthday cake. But he doesnt like it. Just as Reetis holidays are coming to an end, a flock of green parrots come flying to the big tree outside her window. They are all squawking and talking loudly. Mithu goes mad inside his cage, which Reeti has now placed near the window. He squawks, he jumps up and down and spreads his wings. Reeti watches. Are they your friends, Mithu? she asks. Mithu doesnt answer. He only looks at the parrots on the tree. As swiftly as they had come, the parrots fly away. What were they saying, Mithu? Reeti asks. Hello, says Mithu sadly. Hello. Reetis holidays are over. It is the first day of school. Reeti meets all her friends and teachers. During the lunch break she plays happily with her friends. The big trees around the school playground are full of twittering birds. When Reeti reaches home after school, she sees Mithu sitting quietly in his cage. Hello, Mithu, she whispers. He looks at her but doesnt say anything. Reeti puts down her schoolbag. She opens the window. Then she opens the door of the cage. Go, Mithu! she says. Go and find your friends. He looks at her. Go, Mithu! she says again. Fly away! Mithu steps out of his cage. He looks at Reeti one last time. And with a final hello, he spreads his wings and flies away to join his friends. WHO NEEDS A PET? Anyone who wants a loving and loyal friend needs a pet. If you're feeling lonely and lost or mean and mad, a pet is sure to do something... anything to make you glad. A pet will play with you, make you feel better, teach you lots of important things, and bring endless fun into your life. Now, who doesn't want that? SHOULD YOU HAVE A PET OR NOT? Sure, pets are fun, but dont rush out to get one! Think carefully: - Will your parents let you keep a pet? - Do you really want a pet? Remember, a pet is for life. It is not a toy you can throw away once you get bored with it. - Pets need food, clean water, exercise, and love. They also have to be trained, taken to the vet, and given baths. That means extra work, every single day. Do you have the time for that? - Can you forgive your pet if it makes a mess with its muddy paws, or chews your favourite shoes? AM I REALLY READY FOR A PET? Your best friend has a pet, and you wish you had one too! So youre wondering whether you should get a dog, a cat, or maybe, even a rat. Stop right there, before you pick a pet, and ask yourself these questions. Do I have the time to take care of a pet? Having a pet is a h-u-g-e responsibility. Whether it is for training, feeding or plain loving, youve got to spend time on your pet big time! Do I have space at home for a pet? Small pets like cats, fish and birds can adapt to houses of any size. But dogs may need more space to run around and exercise. What kind of pet do I want? If you want a specific kind of pet, talk to a vet or to people who own similar pets. Find out what they eat and how they behave. Then think hard about whether the pet will suit you. Can I afford to have a pet? All pets require food and shelter. Then, there are the visits to the vet for check-ups, vaccinations, and for treatment when the pet falls ill. Will a pet be welcome at home? You may love animals, but do the rest of the family share your feelings? You need to talk this through with your family before you get a pet.""}"

Basha loves food. What he loves more is to cook food. He helps his Ammi in the kitchen everyday. He likes to watch her hands as they chop the brightly-coloured vegetables plump red tomatoes, crisp green capsicums, firm orange carrots, fleshy pink onions... Mmmm! Basha loves the tempting aromas that swirl around Ammi\'s kitchen as the dhals, rice, vegetables, meat, and spices change colour on the stove. He hopes that Ammi will give him a chance to cook a dish on his own someday. One day, Basha and Sainabi come back from school to find Ammi asleep with high fever. Baba is not yet back from his office. Ammis mobile rings. Basha sees that Ammis best friend Saira aunty is calling and answers it quickly. He does not want to wake Ammi up. Im on my way back home from a wedding with lots of friends, Saira aunty explains. She sounds exhausted. We will be passing by your home in about two hours\' time. Do you think we can have dinner at your place? There are 24 of us and 4 are vegetarian. Basha knows that Ammi would love to see them. He and Sainabi are very fond of Saira aunty too. You are most welcome, Basha says. He feels excited as he hangs up the phone. This is his chance to cook a dish on his own! But will he be able to do it? He feels nervous. He opens the fridge and sees many of his favourite vegetables cauliflower, peas, beans. He can also see a bunch of fresh mint leaves peeking out from under the carrots. ""Yes!"" he thinks to himself. ""I have everything I need for a yummy Vegetable Dum Biryani!"" Basha has watched Ammi cook Vegetable Dum Biryani many times for their family of 4. But he now has to cook for 24 people! That is six times the number of people Ammi usually cooks it for! (444444 24. Or, 6x4 24) ""That means,"" thinks Basha to himself, feeling a little nervous, ""I have to cook the biryani six times!"" Would he have enough time to do that? As he starts to lay out six of every vessel he needs for the cooking, Sainabi appears at the kitchen door. What are you up to? she asks, frowning. When Basha explains to her what he is doing, she starts to laugh loudly. Buddhu! she teases him. You dont need to make the dish 6 times! You just have to have to make it ONCE, but with 6 times the quantities of all the ingredients needed. Basha doesn\'t like to be teased by his smart little sister. Of COURSE he doesn\'t have to make the biryani six times! He could kick himself for his silly mistake. ""I knew it all the time,"" he says quickly. ""I just wanted to see if YOU knew it."" Of course you did, Bhai,"" Sainabi says soothingly, but her eyes twinkle mischievously. ""So, tell me, how much rice do we need for 4 people? 1.5 cups. Then youll need 1.5 x 6 9 cups of rice for 24 people,"" Sainabi replies instantly . Basha stares at her. How does Sainabi work out those numbers so quickly in her head? ""That\'s right,"" he says gruffly, measuring out the rice into a big vessel. ""Now, why don\'t you tell me how much we need of all the other ingredients too, and I will tell you if you are right."" ""Sure, Bhai!"" says Sainabi, running to get a pencil and paper. She loves it when her brother involves her in something he is doing. As Basha tells her the list of ingredients needed for four people, she calculates the quantities for 24. ""15 green beans for 4 people,"" calls out Basha. ""That means... 15 x 6 90 green beans for 24!"" says Sainabi. ""34 cup of curd for 4 people."" ""That means 34 x 6 0.75 x 6 4.5 cups of curd for 24,"" says Sainabi, working it out on her paper quickly. ""I hope we have that much curd in the fridge."" ""We do,"" says Basha. ""Next..."" Finally, they have measured out all the ingredients. Can you help me with the chopping too? Basha asks, realizing that there are a lot of vegetables to be chopped. Of course, Bhai, grins Sainabi. Today is her lucky day! Basha first soaks the fine orange strands of saffron in milk and the rice in water. He then joins Sainabi in chopping the vegetables. Then he turns on the stove and starts roasting the spices - cinnamon, cloves, green cardamoms, black cardamoms - and all the chopped vegetables, in ghee. The familiar pleasant aromas of good food start to fill the house. Basha starts to gain confidence in himself. He cant wait to get to his favourite part now - layering and slow-cooking the half-cooked rice, spices and vegetables in a handi. As Basha sets up the handi and starts to slow-cook it on the tawa, the doorbell rings. Before he and Sainabi can get to the door, Ammi has woken up and is greeting the guests with a surprised look on her face. Her surprise turns to worry as she realizes that theyre here for dinner and she hasnt cooked anything. She follows the pleasant smells and reaches the kitchen. Surprise! shout Basha and Sainabi as they whip the lid off the handi. Ammi is stunned. Basha is a great cook, Ammi. He has made biryani! I helped him make it, Sainabi says. Basha smiles proudly at Ammi, thinking that his little sister is not so bad after all. Ammi hugs Basha and Sainabi. Mashallah! she smiles. I have two really fine kids. I am so proud of you both. Why don\'t you join Saira aunty and the others, Ammi? says Basha. Sainabi and I will serve you all. Sainabi nods eagerly. Maybe Bhai will ask her to help him with more things from now on! She can t stop smiling at the thought. This is the best Dum Biryani weve ever had! say Saira aunty and her friends. I agree - 100 percent! says Ammi, licking her fingers. Basha and Sainabi are all smiles! Cook with Basha and Sainabi! Guess what! Basha and Sainabi\'s Ammi sweetly agreed to share her Dum Biryani recipe with us! Be sure there is an adult around when you try it.

Never mind. Maybe you can help him calculate the quantities of various ingredients he needs, like Sainabi did. Go on, try it! 1. If Basha needs 1 onion for a biryani for 4 people, how many will he need for a biryani for 24 people? 2. If Basha needs 72 florets of cauliflower for biryani that serves 24, how many florets should he put into a biryani that serves 3? 3. If the recipe says to put in 34 cups of curd for a biryani for 6 people, how much curd should we put into a biryani for 48 people? 4. To make biryani for 5 people, you need 4 tbsp of ghee. If Basha puts in 32 tbsps, how many people is he cooking for? 5. A biryani that serves 8 needs 2 two-inch sticks of cinnamon. How many two-inch sticks are required for a biryani that serves 64? Once you\'re done calculating, check for answers in the next page. No cheating, okay? Answers: 1. 6 onions 2. 9 florets 3. 6 cups 4. 40 people 5. 16 sticks'}"

Stack them up again, Bonda! I want to try knocking them down from a different angle!"" Without hesitating for a moment, without even frowning, Bonda puts one battered box on top of the other for the fiftieth time. The high, shaky, cardboard tower is perfectly balanced, the way only Bonda knows how to build it. I rev up my super-speedy turbo engine vrooom, VROOM and gun for it, coming in from the right this time. BAM! I crash through, shrieking with delight, as the tower explodes around me. Bonda laughs, clapping as loudly as he did the first time I did this. Dear Bonda. The best, most loyal friend anyone could have. Especially a 10-year-old in a wheelchair. Hi. I\'m Devi, and I\'m from the year 2085 AD. My grandfather is always going on about how much the world has changed since he was my age, back in 2016. It\'s more crowded now, but the air, thankfully, is less polluted, because a great many vehicles now run on electricity or solar power. There are fewer accidents too, because vehicles drive themselves, and they are very careful. There are fewer trees and forests than there used to be, but more are being planted all the time, which is good. But what has REALLY changed, says my grandfather, is technology. There was technology way back in 2016 too, but nothing like what we have now. it has truly made life wonderful. Well, MY life, anyway. It was technology that gave me my best friend. Meet Bonda. Best friend forever, cardboard-tower builder, and ROBOT. I see your eyes pop. Ha! You hadn\'t guessed that, had you? But think about it. Which other friend would cheerfully build you a tower 50 times over without complaining? And which other friend would build it so perfectly every single time? Bonda: I agree! Humans are simply not as accurate or as consistent as we are. And they complain that doing the same thing over and over is boring (I\'ve no idea what that word means, so don\'t ask me!). And they fall ill, and need to go to the toilet a lot. I wonder how they got anything done before we arrived! Building towers is not all Bonda can do, though. I can train him to do many other things bowl me two dozen fast balls in ten minutes so that I can practise my batting, bring down my secret treasure box from the topmost shelf (which is so high that no one else can reach it without a ladder), lift Baba\'s heavy desk so I can see where my tiny gold earring has rolled off to (Ma would yell at me for hours if I lost it)... Things like that. Bonda: Like I said, humans are quite useless compared to us robots. The poor things are stuck at their sad little heights, while we can grow taller and shorter at will, by extending or collapsing our arms and legs. Our eyes can be cameras, telescopes, microscopes, or all three rolled into one! How do I train Bonda? By programming him. Programming means showing him, just once, how something\'s done. For instance, the other day, I wanted him to bring me my secret treasure box, the one I talked about earlier. Here\'s how I did it. First, I directed Bonda to the shelf it was sitting on, drawing the route on the plan of my house he displays on his touchscreen. Can you reach up and scan the top shelf now, B? I said when he got there. His arm shot out and up. As he ran his hand along the length of the shelf, the tiny camera inside his finger clicked away, taking pictures of everything there. When he showed me those pictures, I simply touched the picture of the box I wanted. ""That\'s my secret treasure box, Bonda,"" I said. ""Can you bring it down for me?"" Now, whenever I need the box, I only have to say, ""Secret treasure box!"" and off he goes, straight to the shelf. Once he has learnt something, Bonda never forgets. His memory is fantastic! Bonda: Fantastic? Only to incompetent humans, who can never remember where they left their keys, their glasses, their phones... Yeah, that\'s what my best friend\'s like. And yeah, I am a very lucky girl indeed. Oh, don\'t get me wrong I\'m not weird. I do have human friends who I play with and fight with and go to school with. But I love Bonda more than all of them, because he doesn\'t sulk when I have fun with someone else, or get jealous when I beat him at maths, or mad when I forget to wish him on his birthday... Psst! And this is because... Bonda has no feelings ! But don\'t say that out loud it might make him feel bad. Bonda: Tsk, tsk, Devi, where\'s your logical thinking, girl? You say I don\'t have feelings, and then you worry that I will feel bad. Humans can be logical, but when they ""feel"" sad, or mad, or scared, logic disappears! Pah! Who needs feelings? Wait! Was that a feeling I felt just now? My processor tells me it was. It tells me I am feeling something called disgust... Hmm... I don\'t know how to feel about that. Oh, and here\'s the best part I never have to feel bad that he\'s having fun with another friend instead of me, because... he doesn\'t have any! Bonda: Hey, hey, that\'s not true I do have other friends! The robot waitress at the cafe always says Hello nicely, and so does the robot checkout boy at the grocery store... Wait a minute... I\'ve just processed what Devi has been saying... she only likes me BECAUSE I have no other friends AND no feelings! Not because of who I am! Oh no! I feel a rush of feels I\'m feeling mad, and sad, and... ""Bonda! Are you okay? You\'re overheating, Bonda you have a fever! And your auto shut-down is not working! ""But don\'t worry, my friend, I will take care of you like you have always taken care of me. Listen carefully now, Bonda I\'m going to shut you down now so that your system can recover, ok? Don\'t be scared it will be like going to sleep, that\'s all. And when I start you up again, you\'ll be back, good as new, and we will be best friends again. Do you hear me?"" Bonda: Devi\'s eyes are all wet, like they are when she is sad, or scared. That makes me feel a sad feel. But my processor tells me that her wet eyes mean that she really cares about me. Now I feel a happy feel... So confused... sad-and-happy... happy-and-sad... And shutting dowww... There is a whirr and a hum as Bonda reboots. I fight back my tears. ""Bonda?"" I say. ""Bonda, can you hear me? Do you know who I am? Please tell me your memory isn\'t wiped out! I want you to remember all the fun we\'ve had this past year, all the love..."" Bonda: A-ha! Love. Was that the feel I was feeling, that happy-and-sad feel? Bonda looks at me. ""Hi Devi! What would you like me to do for you today? Shall we play Stack-the-Boxes? Shall I bring you your secret treasure box? Do you want to..."" ""Bonda! You\'re all right! Oh, I\'m glad, glad, GLAD!"" I throw my arms around Bonda and hug him tight. Bonda: And then I do something really odd, something no one has ever programmed me to do. I wrap my arms around my friend Devi, for no logical reason at all. ROBOTS: YESTERDAY, TODAY AND TOMORROW Will there be a Bonda for every Devi by the year 2085? We\'ll have to wait and see, but there is no denying that robots will be far more visible even in 25 years from now, by the year 2040. Who or what is a robot? If you said a robot is a machine that looks and acts like a human, except it moves jerkily, has a flat, expressionless voice, and eyes that flash when it is turned on, you\'ve obviously been watching too many movies and TV shows. Because, actually, a robot is any electro-mechanical machine guided by a computer program or electronic circuits"". Yup, it doesn\'t have to look like a human at all. Which is why you may not have realised that there are robots all around us, already! Really? Where? Well, they are in factories, warehouses, orchards, hospitals and even homes. They may look like large mechanical arms, like the ones in car manufacturing plants, welding, gluing and painting car parts. Or they may look like tiny cameras, like the ones in hospitals, attached to thin hair-like tubes, entering our intestines and arteries to check them out for problems. Some robots look like flat round discs, working in homes and offices, buzzing around and cleaning floors at night when everyone is asleep. Some look like small wheeled vehicles, going into war zones, finding dangerous landmines, or rolling across the surfaces of the moon or Mars, taking pictures and collecting samples to send to scientists back on Earth. I wish I could see a robot for myself! If you have ever used, or even seen, a computer or a smartphone, you have \'seen\' a robot! Yes, they are in those devices as well. Some of them even have names, like Siri and Cortana (have you heard of them?). They can help us find useful information - stuff for school projects, traffic reports (which roads have heavy traffic today? What is a good alternative route to take?), entertainment (where is the new Deepika Padukone movie running? And when is the next show?), and much more. They can even book our bus and train tickets, order our groceries, and tell us exactly how many calories we have burnt after a game of football. What does the future of robots look like? What will the world really be like by, say, 2040, as far as robots are concerned? We may not have robots walking our streets in India by 2040, but we will definitely be surrounded by robots of one kind or another without knowing it. It is quite likely that there will be driverless robot cars on our streets. We may have microscopic robots in our contact lenses that help us take pictures we won\'t even have to hold our phones or cameras up to take them (but how will we take selfies??).

Appa... come quick! cried Langlen. Langlens parents found her crouching by the almirah watching three kittens playing with each other, mewling softly. Imma... started Langlen. Shhh, softly, said Imma. Kittens are easily scared. Suddenly, a big orange cat jumped in from the window. She ignored them and briskly went by and lay down. The three kittens rushed over and started suckling. Langlen and her parents tiptoed out. Langlen asked, Wasnt the grey one the Mamma-Cats kitten as well? It was, replied Appa. They why wasnt it orange? Like the Mamma-Cat? Maybe the Pappa-Cat is grey. As Langlen was thinking about it, Appa continued, The grey kitten has colouring like the Pappa-Cat, just like Langlen has curly hair like Appa! But everyone says I look just like Imma. See, we even have clefts on our chins, which makes it look like our chins are divided. You have a bit of both of us, because you are our sweet Langlen, said Imma hugging her tight. Does the grey kitten also have a bit from both Pappa-Cat and Mamma-Cat? Yes. All creatures with two parents have traits from both parents, explained Appa. A trait ? Oh wait, let me guess. Would my curly hair be called a trait ? Yes, thats a trait, Langlen. Any quality or characteristic you have is a trait. Can you think of others? asked Imma. Hmm... my height? Yes, thats another. The colour of your eyes, shape of your ears, length of your fingers and toes, and shape of your nose are all some of your characteristics, explained Imma. My curly hair is a trait from Appa and cleft chin is a trait from Imma. Did you get those traits from your parents? YES! You catch on quick. And they got their traits from their parents, said Imma. But, asked Langlen puzzled, neither my grandmas nor my grandpas have cleft chins. Where did you get the trait from? Sometimes traits skip a generation or more. My grandfather, whom I called Pupu, had a cleft chin. His children, which included my mother, did not have that trait. Then I got it and passed it on to you. This makes me just a collection of traits from all of you, said Langlen, a little sadly. Imma quickly hugged her. No, Langlen. The passing of traits from parents to children is called heredity . We might share traits, but each one of us is different. Your combination of traits makes you unique! Look at me, Langlen, said Appa. Im completely unique. Very tall, with long and curly hair on my head, face and ears. I am also the man with the widest feet in the world. What would you do if you had long curly hair on your ears?"" Hmm.... I would plait it, Appa, and put colourful rubber-bands! Imma smiled at the two of them. Women dont have ear hair, Langlen, but you seem to have got your fathers trait for silly humour! Appa went out of the room and Langlen snuggled into Immas lap. I have one more question. Ebok always says you had dimples like her. Where did they go? Laughing, Imma said, I did get my mothers trait for dimples. But then, every trait has many influences. Some influences made it come and others made it disappear. Ebok: Grandmother in Manipuri Appa came back with a covered plate. I am the influence which has made these yummy things magically appear on this plate! So saying, he pulled the napkin off the plate. It was filled with hot vadas. And we are the influences which will make them disappear? said Langlen, stuffing her mouth without waiting for an answer. Understand the Difficult Words: Imma: Mother in Manipuri Ebok: Grandmother in Manipuri Pupu: Grandfather in Manipuri Cleft: Divided Traits: Characteristic in a person, e.g., curly hair, cleft chin, dimples Heredity: Passing of traits from parents to children Generation : All the people that are born and live in about the same time Unique: One of a kind Influence: To have an effect on something Vadas: Fried savoury dish Make Your Own Family Tree As you may have already guessed, Langlen\'s mother is from Manipur and father from Tamil Nadu. Would you like to map out your own family tree just as Langlen did (pg 7 8)? Grab a paper and pen, and do it right away! If you get lost, you can always ask your parents for help. WHAT WOULD YOUR IMAGINARY PET LOOK LIKE? Straight or curly hair? Round nose or triangular nose? One leg, two legs or many more legs? A tail like a dog\'s or lion\'s?

After a lunch of beans and kofta, Maa would read the newspaper on her favourite chair and Baba would sneak away to take a nap. Fatima could patter away with her book into the lively green forest near her house. The forest creatures would be sleeping, so it would be just her, curled up in the quiet hug of the forest trees. Fatima would sit down in the shade of the Arjuna tree and gaze into the leafy Up World. Maa had warned her not to climb the trees branches. It was safe down below. Fatima didnt know what was in the scary Up World. But that day, Fatima was in for a surprise. As she turned a page, Fatima felt a dull THUMP! on her head. Ouch! she yelled, rubbing her sore head. It was a tiny book, barely the size of a pea. Fatima looked up and saw a furry animal trying to hide behind a bough of leaves. Hello! Is this book yours? she asked, peering into the Up World. But she got no answer. The pea-sized book belonged to Gopa, a young dormouse who lived in the Up World. Gopas little house, made of soft dry leaves and twigs, was in the Arjuna tree as well. The dormouse had often seen Fatima reading, and loved the yellow ribbons in her hair. But Gopas Amma had warned her about the terrors of the Down World. All the animals were fearful of Fatima and other human beings and tried to remain invisible to the Down World. That Sunday, Gopa had been swinging on her green, leafy hammock and reading. She was about to turn the last page when a strong breeze blew the book out of her small, furry paws. Down it went! It bounced on the branches and floated away. The book fell THWACK! and hit Fatima on her head. Gopas tail quivered and ears twitched. The Up and Down World should never meet, she thought and bolted home. Fatima didnt climb the tree but kept squinting and trying to read the book. The letters were too small! Finally, she decided to return the book to the shadowy, furry creature. Fatima was really clever next Sunday she tied five shiny, red balloons around her waist and suddenly, she was floating up. To the Up World! Up , Up , and Up went Fatima, until she reached the tree tops. Gopa was brushing her bushy tail when she spotted five, shiny red balloons! Oh, balloons! Maybe it is someones birthday, she thought excitedly. But what was this? There was the girl with the yellow ribbons attached to the shiny, red balloons. Run, run away! squeaked Gopa, The Down World humans are here! But Fatima was faster. Fatima offered Gopa the book and asked, Is this yours? Gopa grabbed the book quickly and smiled. Fatima giggled. She caught Gopa staring at her ribbons and tied one in a neat bow around her tail. Fatima and Gopa held hands and went off exploring! Fatima and Gopa ran and skipped over the gaps in the trees of the canopy forest. They bugged Baankey the fruit bat, who was sleeping upside down. Baankey did not like being poked. He grunted grumpily, and flapped away to the next branch. These kids will never let me rest, he thought. Soon he was away in Dreamsville, where he was hanging out in a fig tree, biting into the fleshy, sweet fruits. Gopa helped Fatima hop over the long lines of weaver ants who were too busy to even stop and say hello. With long spindly legs and bubble-shaped bodies, the weaver ants scampered all over the tree. These ants love teams! They work together to stitch large leaves into cozy nests. Next, they bumped into Firki the canopy frog. He looks like a rainbow, thought Fatima. Yellow feet, red eyes, and a blue body! Firki was so surprised to see a human in his canopy that he almost let go of his strong grip on the branch! He croaked a weak hello and turned to pounce on his lunch a grasshopper! I thought only the Down World had frogs, said Fatima, who loved chasing frogs around her house pond. Hari the Hornbill was watching them from a distance. He really wanted to be friends with them! Hari was a friendly bird but he made very loud noises, which is why some animals kept him at a distance. But Gopa and Fatima didnt mind at all. The Up World isnt so scary after all, thought Fatima. How silly I was. The people from the Down World are pretty cool, thought Gopa. I am not frightened anymore. Sob! Sniff. Uh, oh, I think Vaidya is crying, said Gopa. Her sharp ears picked up sounds easily. The two friends hurried towards Vaidya, a green vine snake, who was very shy. What is wrong, Vaidya? asked Gopa. Vaidya sobbed, looking greener than usual. They cut down the tree that was my home. Now I dont know where to go, he cried. Baankey, Dipu and other animals also popped out of their homes. Vaidya was homeless. A new, concrete road is going to be built and humans cut down my tree, wailed Vaidya. Cutting down their home! The Up World was alarmed and upset. We must help Vaidya, said Gopa. Fatima, Gopa and their new friends formed a search party. They searched and searched and found a snug tree-hole home for Vaidya. Fatima layered the home with soft leaves and orange flowers, Vaidyas favourite colour. Vaidya loved his new home. I cant believe I have so many friends! We need to have a party, he said. And what a party it was. Everyone got their favourite food. Gopa got nuts, Hari got fruits, Baankey was too sleepy to get anything, the ants brought home-stitched, leafy cushions to sit on! Nobody wanted Firkis grasshoppers. As for Fatima, she had to get the balloons. For the first time ever, the Up World and the Down World were just One World. Meet Fatimas Friends in the Up World Gopa and her friends live in the vast forest canopies of India. That means they dont live in the Down World, like us human beings. Instead they live in the Up World, in the swinging branches and swaying leaves of trees. Many creatures that live in forest canopies are now used to living in tree tops. If youre lucky you will spot some of them, but most of these animals know how to hide themselves cleverly. So you have to be patient! When scientists go to learn about these canopies, they have to use ropes or ladders, because the trees are very tall. Some even use very large hot-air balloons to get up there. You can imagine just how Up Fatima had to go with her balloons. Here are some of the animals who living in forest canopies: Malabar spiny dormouse: This bushy-tailed animal likes to live in trees in quiet, undisturbed forests. It loves to eat fruits and nibbles on pepper sometimes. This dormouse sleeps like a hedgehog, curled up with its tail protruding OUT. Hornbill: These birds are vividly coloured with long and strong beaks. These sociable birds love to eat fruits, insects and even small animals. They make nests in holes in trees and when they have babies, they make a mud wall to cover up the hole, much like making a house! Green vine snake: A bright green, slender tree snake that hides in the leaves of a canopy. It moves very slowly. You can find them not only in India but also Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. Tree frog: There are several kinds of tree frogs and they come in various colours. They can have white lips or red or yellow eyes and brown feet. They are usually very small, half the size of your palm, because they have to jump around delicate branches. They spend most of their lives up in the trees. Fruit bat (aka Megabat): They hang upside down. Try to imagine what the world looks like to them! They love to eat fruits and being busy in the trees. They can be super noisy too. You can hear them from a long way off. They have keen senses of sight and smell and are very helpful to us because they pollinate the flowers and fruits we love.'}"

His shoulders hurt, but his head hurt even more. It had been a long day. The Amulet around his neck flashed once. Manikantan, put your Schoolbag where it belongs, said the Coffee Table. Yes Manikantan, agreed the Schoolbag, I dont belong here. I suggest you put me in your Room in a proper place. Mani knew better than to argue. He picked up the Schoolbag and trudged towards his Room. He put away his Schoolbag on the Desk, kicked off his Shoes, and then lay down on the Bed. He groaned. Are you not feeling well, Manikantan? asked the Room. Im fine. Leave me alone. Mani moved the Amulet to the back of his neck. He longed to throw it into the Trash. The objects in the House would still be able to spy on him but at least they wouldnt be able to talk to him. You groaned twice. The Rooms voice sounded muffled. Do you have a headache, Manikantan? Leave me alone. Then after a pause, Mani added, Yes. Tsk, tsk. So sorry to hear that, Manikantan. The Room sounded very sympathetic. I have let your Amma know. Perhaps you are hungry. That may be why youre having a headache. How about a nice hot cup of chai and some pakodas?"" Chai and pakodas would be nice, though Mani wished the Room hadnt told amma he had a headache. Now she would worry. Okay. Great. I have told the Kitchen. And Manikantan, put your Shoes in the ShoeRack. Yes, said the ShoeRack, I have plenty of space. Waiting. Mani knew he should get up, but he didnt feel like it. Maybe he should just sleep a little. He was so tired. Waiting, said the ShoeRack. Mani closed his eyes and thought of Anandpuram. His Amma called it a village, but to Mani it was home. He recalled the graceful sway of the tall palm trees and the vast rose-blue sky. In the morning the gentle gusts of wind carried the wonderful smell of porottas cooking over charcoal fires. The winter months were the best. The cool air was nothing like the air-conditioned air in Smart Citys buildings. No, wait, the rainy season was the best! It was such fun to watch the fat heavy warm droplets splish-splosh into the river Periyar. Oh, how hed enjoyed sitting by the riverbank. So quiet, so peaceful. If only things could go back to the way they had been. Waiting, said the ShoeRack. Mani sat up with a sigh. He didnt mind being given helpful hints, but this was too much. It was almost like being a prisoner and nobody, not even Amma, understood. Mani placed the Shoes on the ShoeRack and headed for the Kitchen. He had to warm the pakodas himself, but the FoodGenie brewed some chai. It tasted exactly like the kind of chai a machine would make. Is the chai to your satisfaction, Manikantan? asked the FoodGenie. As good as cow urine. Thank you. Manis Amulet beeped. It was his mother. She wanted to know whether he was feeling better. How is your headache, kanna ? Her loving voice made Mani feel very sorry for himself. The headaches better, Amma. Hows work? Wonderful. Its not like my old Anandpuram job at all. How was your day, kanna ? Great. His Amma worked so hard, such long hours, worried so much about him, cared so much. She was his mother and father and all the family he had in the world. He just didnt have the heart to tell the truth. I had a great day. You sure, Mani? Your SchoolBag told me you were sent to the Principal. What was that about? Nothing. Mani? Nothing! You can ask the Schoolbag. It seems to know everything. Mani, whats the matter? Look, why dont you go to the Mirror? I want to see you. Whatever the problem is, we can solve it. No, we cant solve it! Mani felt tears beginning to form. He tried to press back the tears but they kept coming like the rain on Periyar. He knew the House would report to his mother that her son was crying. Everything he did was watched and reported. He knew it was all for his own good and he knew Amma loved him, but sometimes, he wanted things to be. He closed his finger around the Amulet, and pulled the chain so hard, it snapped. Mani threw the Amulet into the Trash, and ignoring its shouting, ran out of the apartment. Mani didnt know how long he ran or where he went or how exactly he got lost. Without the Amulet to guide him, he simply didnt know where he was going. But the smart objects of the City had guessed he was lost and alerted the proper authorities. After his mother had thanked the nice policeman who brought him back, Mani took the Amulet from her. He was ashamed but also really glad to be back. I have adjusted some of the settings, said his mother. The House will now give you a little more privacy. But it is really for your own good, Mani. I know, mumbled Mani. So how was it, your little adventure? Mani shuddered. The streets had been filled with people but they were all somehow different. They were all strangers. With the Amulet, the streets were filled with many people he almost knew. Their names, the kind of music they liked, who their friends were, lots of fun stuff like that. Without the Amulet even simple things, like crossing the streets, had become difficult. There was no voice to tell him: You can cross now, Manikantan. And nobody knew him either. When he had passed the poster for the movie \'Mission Maut\' , the hero of the movie Vikram Seven said: Hi, do you like action movies? If hed had the Amulet, Vikram would have said: Hey Manikantan, nice to see you again, yaar, lets talk. Without the Amulet, every object was as stupid as a stone. I thought so, said his mother, with a small smile. Now Mani, you know you shouldnt have left the House without the Amulet? We were so worried! Im sorry I broke the rules, Amma. Thats not always a bad thing, kanna. But you are a big boy now. You have to be more mature. Our life here is pretty happy, na ? Mani thought of Anandpuram. An Amulet would be pretty useless in Anandapuram. Maybe that wasnt such a good thing. He nodded. His mother was very sweet. She prepared dinner by hand well, mostly by hand, the FoodGenie helped, just a little. Then she read him a story as he drank his milk. Later she tucked him into bed, gave him a good-night kiss, and touched her Amulet to his. He could tell Amma was very tired. Good night, Amma. Good night, kanna . Good night, Manikantan, good night, Amma, whispered the House. Sleep tight, and I wont let the bedbugs bite. The Internet of Things Does your alarm clock know that you have exams tomorrow? Will it remind you to set the alarm so that you can get up early to do a final revision? If you are going somewhere and get lost, can your shoes give step-by-step directions? Of course not. Today, most of the objects we are surrounded are just objects. They dont really know anything about you or the objects in the house. The clock is just a clock. The radio is just a radio. The clock does not know what the radio does and vice versa. They are not connected to you or to other people or to the objects in the world. But things are about to change. Soon, all human-made objects will be interconnected. They will be more aware of what is going on around them. They will be smarter. They will be able to exchange data and keep track of your needs in a better way. When objects get interconnected and can communicate with each other, as if by an invisible telephone network, we say we have an Internet of Things. If it were up to you, would you like to live in Smart City or in Anandpur? Why? What if they all started talking? Count the number of objects in your home or classroom (door, chair, clock, radio, books, etc.). Are you surprised by the number? Imagine how it would be if they could all see and hear and speak. How would your life change?'}"

He loves tree-places because they are full of life. No-tree-places make him terribly sad, because they are full of dead things. Years ago, Jadav was walking along the banks of the great Brahmaputra River when he arrived at a big, empty no-tree-place. It was dry and hot. The sand was powdery and striped. Striped sand? How odd. Jadav went closer to take a better look. Oh, but they weren\'t stripes at all! The ground was covered in snakes! Last nights floods must have washed them ashore, Jadav thought. These snakes weren\'t slinking and slithering and swaying about like regular, healthy snakes. When Jadav walked among them, they didn\'t hiss or run away or try to bite him. They just lay about like old ropes, tired and still. ""Poor snakes! They\'re dying from the heat! If only they had some shade to lie in! If only this no-tree-place had some trees in it!"" Jadav couldn\'t bear to watch the snakes die. It made him so terribly sad that he sat down and began to cry. But he quickly came to his senses. ""No more crying. From now on: only trying!"" He jumped up, ran back to his village and began collecting all the bamboo shoots he could carry in his bag. ""Regular plants won\'t grow in the hot sand, but bamboo will. Bamboo is strong!"" Jadav brought the shoots to the no-tree-place and started planting them everywhere. It was hard, hot work, and it took years. The river grew thin one summer and flooded the next, sometimes bringing more sand and sometimes taking it away. Heavy rains came and went. But Jadav kept on planting. In time, the bamboo took root and began to grow. As it grew, it brought shade, and the shade brought insects. The insects burrowed into the ground, and the earth below the bamboo trees began to change. The dry and white became rich and brown, and the dead sand became living soil. Jadav was no longer sad. But he wasn\'t happy either. He looked around his bamboo grove and thought, ""A few-trees-place is nice, I know. But how wonderful it would be if this were a many-trees-place!"" The idea thrilled him. So Jadav went back to his village and began collecting many more seeds and saplings. He filled three big bags with Arjun and ejar and gulmohar and koroi and moj and himolu. ""Now that our few-trees-place has lovely brown soil, we can plant all these and more!"" Jadav brought his new saplings and seeds to the few-trees-place and planted them all around. It was hard work, his back hurt, and it took many years. The orange and blue skies turned purple and pink, and villages became towns. The wind grew laden with dust, and the river became grey. But Jadav\'s insect friends helped to till the soil, and his tall bamboos gave him shade and cooled the air. And Jadav kept on planting. Soon, his Arjun, ejar and gulmohar, his koroi, moj and himolu, and all his many other plants dug in, took root and started growing. As they grew, they spread new seeds, and the new seeds, in turn, took root. Shoots became trunks, trunks grew branches, and the branches reached for the sky. The few-trees-place that was once a no-tree-place now became a wonderful, green many-trees-place. But what\'s a many-trees-place without many tree-creatures? When one came, the others followed. First, came the birds. They flocked and flew in from near and far, to make their nests in Jadav\'s tree-place. There were vultures and pelicans and storks and ducks. And warblers and thrushes and wagtails and chats. Next, came the animals. They skipped and swung and sauntered in, to make their homes in the many-trees-place. There were buffaloes and deer and rabbits and gibbons. And elephants and tigers and rhinos. Finally, there came the snakes. They slithered and swayed and sashayed in, to cool themselves in the shade of Jadav\'s trees. When Jadav saw the snakes, he sat down and cried happy tears. He was so happy that he wasn\'t even afraid of getting bitten. Jadav\'s tree-place had filled with feathers and beaks and wings, with claws and tails and fangs. There were spots and splashes, stripes and flashes, and green, green, everywhere. The tree-place was a forest, at last. And Jadav was a happy man. Then Jadav had another thought. ""Many trees in one place is good, I know. But how wonderful it\'d be if there were many trees in every place!"" So he grabbed his bags of seeds and started walking across the world. And as he walked, Jadav started planting the seeds in all the no-tree-places he saw. And he planted. And planted. And planted. But there are so many no-tree-places in the world. There are more no-tree-places than tree-places now. This is terribly sad, but Jadav does not sit down and cry this time. Jadav plants. And plants. And plants some more. Its going to be hard work, bringing all the old forests back. The seas have begun rising, and the winds grow cold. Towns have become cities, and Jadav is growing old. But he keeps on planting. And planting. And planting. Jadav will keep on planting until the whole world is a happy, lovely lots-of-trees-place. Jadav in Real Life Jadav Mulai Payeng is a conservationist and recipient of the Padmashree, one of the highest civilian honours awarded by the Indian government. Jadav lives in Majuli, Assam. At the age of 16, distressed by the sight of dying snakes that had washed up on a sandbar banking the Brahmaputra, Jadav decided to plant some trees in the spot. He started small, with bamboos, and grew an entire forest, plant by painstaking plant. This was back in 1979. Over the next three decades, Jadav and his tree-planting have managed to change the soil in the barren area. The 550-hectare sandbar is now a lush, dense forest and home to a variety of flora and fauna, including elephants, tigers, apes, deer and many species of local and migratory birds. Jadav continues to visit and nurture his forest every day, planting wherever he finds empty patches. Growing Up With a Mango Tree: a Tree-Planting Activity Just ate a mango? Loved it? Want another? You can go to a shop and buy one, of course. But it\'s a lot more fun (and free!) to use the seed of the mango you just ate and make a few fruits of your own. All you need is time and patience. First, find a nice patch of empty land near your house. Get a friend, sibling or grown-up to help you plant the seed you saved in that patch. Make sure the soil is loose and there\'s plenty of sun. It may take several weeks of waiting, watering and watching before your seed turns into a plant, so don\'t worry and definitely don\'t hurry. Once your seed germinates and grows into a healthy mango plant, get ready for a lot more waiting, watering and watching. Take care that your plant doesn\'t get eaten up by insects or animals, or get stepped on by someone. If all this waiting is making you feel bored, read a few books, sing some songs, and plant some more plants! After a few years, as you grow taller, your mango plant will grow tall with you, until it becomes a big tree that you can climb and picnic under. This is when the real fun begins. By now, your tree will have started making its own mangoes, which you and your friends can eat. Even better, those mangoes will soon start attracting other mango-loving creatures to your tree: birds, ants, squirrels, bats, monkeys, spiders and lots more. Some of these creatures will come to eat the fruit, some will come to feed on the tree\'s sap, some to drink nectar from its flowers, and some creatures will even come to eat some of the other creatures hanging around the tree. But it\'s not all about eating. Some creatures may come just to rest in your tree\'s shade, or to take a nap in its branches. Your tree has many different uses for every different creature! Spend some time every day watching who visits your mango tree, at which time of the day they come, and what they do. Write down what you see in your notebook. Also draw pictures of what you see. See how much you\'ve done and learned with just one mango seed? Isn\'t tree-planting fun? Now imagine how much fun Jadav must have had planting his entire forest full of trees!'}"

Ali and Gaurav and Sumi and Rani, they kept asking me about it when we were going home from school. I told them that I didnt know what they were talking about, but thats not true. How can I not know? See, you made me lie to my friends. Yours sincerely, Me Hi again, Ma says that it is not good to stare at people, but I can see that everyone stares at you. They stare at me too because I have to hang around with you and be your mentor. Why did you come to our school? Why couldnt you continue going to whatever school you went to earlier? Do you know what happened yesterday? Gaurav, Ali and two of their friends from Class VII cornered me after school to ask about you-know-what. They took my bag and wouldnt give it back. Then they threw it into the thicket by the side of the road and I had to scramble down into the mountainside to get it. I tore my shirt and Ma was angry with me. This is all your fault. Me Hello, I keep telling them that they can ask you whatever they want to know. Whats the point of asking me? How am I supposed to know why you have that thing or how it works? To be really honest, I cant say Im not curious myself or that I dont have the same questions the others are asking me. Yes, I noticed it the first day when you came into the classroom. I saw how you did everything with one hand and how your left hand never moved. At first I couldnt tell what the problem was. Then, when I came closer, I saw that something wasnt quite right. It looked weird, like it was covered in plastic or something. Then I thought it was a toy hand. It took me some time to understand. Also, I saw what happened at lunch. See you, Me Hello, My oldest sister, the one whos studying engineering in Delhi, called today. I told her, Theres a girl in my class and she has a fake hand, and she said that the term is prosthetic hand. Listen, I have some advice for you. You may be new and all, but if you want people to stop staring at you and talking about you, you have to stop standing in the corner all the time. Why dont you play with us? Why dont you come on the swing? Everyone loves the swing. Its been two weeks, and you can jolly well come by yourself. I am not going to be your minder for ever. Sometimes I dont know what to say to you. Me Hi again, After the lunch incident that day, Ive been watching you. Im just curious. Is it weird to have one hand? Is it only your hand or is your entire arm fake, sorry, prosthetic? Today, Sumi, Gaurav and I walked to school together. They were playing a game they made up called One-Hand Challenge. The rule is, you have to do things with one hand. Like, packing your bag or buttoning your shirt. Sumi couldnt tie her shoelaces and she forgot about it and tripped and fell. She got a cut on her chin. Miss saw it and, even though she put some antiseptic cream on it, she scolded Sumi for being careless. You cant run around in the mountains with your shoelaces untied. What will happen if you fall while going home or something? I think adults worry too much. Yours truly, Me Hi, Do you know what a coincidence is? Its like when you talk about something and the same thing happens sometime later in a completely unrelated way. In my last letter, I was telling you about Sumi and the shoelaces, and then, today, I saw you tying your shoelaces. Wow, that was awesome! I think you did it faster than I can do it with two hands. If you were my friend, I would challenge you to a shoelace-tying race. Or no, maybe I would ask you to teach me how to do it with one hand. I have to confess, I did try to tie my shoelace with one hand when I got home. But its impossible. How do you do it? Maybe Ill ask you tomorrow. Curious, Me Hi, So, after what you said, Ive tried to do a lot of things with only one hand, but its so difficult! I still dont get how you do it, like having a bath, wearing your clothes, packing your bag. Since that day at lunch, I did realize that you have to do some things differently, but its not like you dont do almost everything the rest of us do. Listen, Im sorry about what I said earlier... about playing with us. I guess you were just feeling shy. And also about coming on the swing. I tried and its hard to get your balance if you dont hold it with two hands. But youre great in the jungle gym, even if you dont hang from the bars, and you can run really fast, even faster than Ali, who won the first prize at Sports Day. Bye, Me Hello! That movie was really funny, no? I laughed so much that my stomach hurt and it was like I was crying. I always like it when they show movies in school. It means no classes. Last time, before you came to our school, they showed this movie about a tiger cub who got lost. It was quite scary, mostly because it was a true story. Later someone found it and managed to get it back to its family. True stories like that are called documentaries, did you know that? Tiger cubs are cute, no? Last year, there was a puppy near our house. It was very cute too, but it grew up and then it wasnt so cute any more. Got to go now! Me Hello, hello! Did you know? I was so surprised when I saw you on the bus. I had no idea my father worked in the same place as yours! But Im so happy you came for the office picnic, because last year when they took us, there were no other children my age and I got really bored. Okay, Im really tired, so Im going now. See you in school tomorrow. Me Hi, I think I should warn you, Principal Sir becomes slightly insane whenever Annual Day comes along. He might yell at you he yells at everyone so dont take it personally. My ma says that hes under a lot of pressure because our Annual Day performance reflects on him. Im not sure what that means, but he does look stressed out. Did you see his hair? It was like he touched a loose wire and got an electric shock! Though I think it was very mean of Rani to put a frog in his chair. Okay, Im going now before he catches me writing this letter! Me Hey, Your new hand is so cool! No offence, but the old one was a bit boring. It was just there. The new one is like magic, and you can move the fingers and grip with it! I hope you didnt mind that I asked to shake hands. I just said it before I could think. Maybe tomorrow we can do some experiments to find out if you can lift stuff with it. Oh! I just realized, the last couple of letters I wrote to you, I didnt mention your prosthetic hand at all. Its like I forgot all about it and wanted to tell you so many other things. The funny thing is, Im not that curious about your hand any more. I dont know why. Your friend, Me THE FRIEND-O-METER QUIZ How good are you at helping people fit in?

No? Never mind. Now, have you heard of the Internet? Yes? Great! But what IS the Internet? Did you say I am not quite sure, but I know it has something to do with computers? Youre right it does. But thats not the whole answer. Whats the WHOLE answer then? Hmmm. We need an EXPERT to answer that. And guess what - I know JUST the person! Shes usually to be found near a computer, so lets go straight to the computer now. Hi Nettikutti! Here is a group of kids to meet you! Come on out, come on out, wherever you are! THERE you are! Go on, kids, say hello! And dont be fooled by her cuteness and her size she holds a LOT of information in her little head! So Nettikutti, heres what everyone wants to know - What IS the Internet? Ooooh. BIG question. Lets see how I can put it simply. The Internet (short for INTERconnected NETworks) is a large, large, LARGE collection of computers from all over the world that are connected to each other. The computers could be gigantic computers (the kind research laboratories or governments own), desktop computers (the kind you see in banks and computer centres), laptops (the kind people sling across their shoulders and carry with them), cellphones (the kind that ring so loudly and annoyingly in movie halls), and even the little music players with the itty-bitty headphones that seem to grow out of people's ears. All these computers are connected with each other either by real wires and cables - cables that run above the ground, underground, even under the sea (big computers) - OR by wireless signals (laptops, cellphones, music players). So you see, you dont have to be sitting in one place and have your computer plugged into an electric socket to be on the Internet you can even be connected to the world while you are on the move! Thats it? We thought the Internet was about talking to friends and downloading film songs and booking movie tickets and looking for information for school projects and finding the telephone number of a hospital! But that's not the Internet. All THAT is part of something truly magical, something called wait for it. the World Wide Web! This World Wide Web - lets call it W3 for short is a large, large, LARGE collection of what are called PAGES (there are some 40 BILLION public pages on the W3 now!). A page could contain information in the form of words, numbers, photographs, songs, video clips, and more. This collection of pages (or the W3) sits on the Internet, in those millions of computers and cell phones and music players. The Internet is a network of networks made up of computers, laptops, tablets and mobile phones. W3 is a collection of connected pages, that is on the Internet. So the W3 is NOT the Internet itself, but one PART of it, the coolest part. If you think of the Internet as a restaurant, then the W3 is the most popular dish on the menu. And the spoon that helps you dig into this dish and get to your favourite bits of it is called a Web Browser. Oooooh! Now youve made us hungry, Nettikutti! But do tell us more about what makes the W3 so popular. Sure! The W3 is super-exciting because it includes: Email which allows you to send letters to anyone anywhere in the world and have them receive it in under a minute! The same letter if you were sending it to someone in America, say, would have taken 15 days to reach him if you had mailed it through a post office. And it would have cost you a lot of money too. But email is free! Search which helps you find useful and useless! information on a million different subjects. You may want to know which states the River Ganga flows through, or see what the Statue of Liberty looks like. You may want to hear the latest film song of your favourite actor, or watch an episode of a serial that you missed. You may want to find out the score in the T20 World Cup, or see if there are tickets available on the Mumbai-Pune train tomorrow. If someone whose computer is connected to the Internet, somewhere in the world, has decided to share this information with the world and put it on the W3, you will be able to find it - instantly! And for free! But Nettikutti, HOW do you find the page that you want, out of all those billions of pages? Easy! Each page also has a unique address which helps your Web Browser find it, just like your home address helps the postman to find your house. So if you know the pages address, you can go to it immediately. What if you dont know the pages address? No problem! You can use a wonderful service called a Search Engine, which also sits on the W3, to help you. Sharing which helps you share ANYTHING you want a song you love, your dogs picture, a clever way to solve a difficult maths problem, your big idea for keeping our streets free of litter with everyone in the world! No single person owns the Internet or the W3, and no government has authority over it, so you dont need to ask ANYONE for permission before you share. Think about how cool that is! Until now, you had books and movies and television and newspapers giving you information, talking to you, but YOU couldnt talk back to THEM. With the W3, everything has changed you can listen, and YOU CAN HAVE YOUR SAY too. And you dont have to be an important person or a grown-up to do this. THIS is what makes the W3 so fantastic it is a truly free and open AND democratic system it gives EVERYONE who is connected to the Internet a VOICE. Governments do 'control' the internet in their own countries, however. Governments can even 'switch off' the internet, so that their citizens cannot access it, and some have actually done so for short or long periods. Wow! Thats great, Nettikutti! Now, on a completely different tack we understand why the first two Ws in W3 stand for World Wide, but why is it called a Web? Isnt it the INTERNET that is actually a web? Good question! Youre right about the Internet being a web (because of all those computers being connected to each other), but SO IS THE W3. Let me explain. Remember those billions of pages that the W3 is made of? THEY are all connected, or hyperlinked, to each other as well! That means you can go from one page to another almost endlessly! Do you see now how the W3 is ALSO a web, a HU-MUN-GOUS web of knowledge and information and entertainment for all humankind to enjoy and use? We do, we do! Now we have to have to have to know - who was the superbrain who came up with such a wonderful idea? I thought youd never ask! For the answer to that question, we have to go back in time some 20 years, to a nuclear research laboratory called CERN in Switzerland. Many scientists there, and across other labs in Europe, were working on projects together, but there was no way to share their work with each other quickly and easily. They would have to actually travel to each others' labs, or use the post office and courier services, to let their teams know how far they had progressed. One of the scientists at CERN, Tim Berners-Lee, was getting a little fed up of this, so he decided to figure out a way to share information better and faster. He came up with a big idea called hypertext a way of linking information on computers together to do this. The idea worked really well for CERN, and everyone was really happy. And THEN - Tim Berners-Lee had his SECOND big idea. He felt his invention would benefit other people as well, and that it would be selfish to limit it to CERN. He talked to the authorities at CERN, and persuaded them to let him share the idea of hypertext with other scientists all over the world, for free. They agreed! Berners-Lee shared his idea, and urged everyone he shared it with to improve it or add to it as they wished. The idea of being able to access and share information from anywhere on earth instantly was SO powerful and SO attractive that a LOT of people began to use hypertext. Since anyone could use their own ideas to make it better, people all over the world felt they 'owned' the internet, that it was THEIRS. Which was a wonderful thing. By 1993, the W3 had EXPLODED, with millions of people beginning to use it. Today, more than TWO BILLION people use the W3 in some way that is almost one-third of all the human beings on the planet! Hmmmm. Life would be very different today if Tim Berners-Lee had decided not to be so generous, right? Absolutely! So dont you think we should cheer both him and the W3 with a big Hip, Hip Hurray? We should! We should, Nettikutti! Here we go. To Berners-Lee and the W3 - Hip Hip... ... HURRAYYYYYY!""}"

We set out in a little boat, hoping for a BIG adventure! When we reached the dive site, we carefully checked all our equipment and put on our fins and masks. As soon as we were underwater, we were greeted by a school of yellowback fusiliers. There were so many different creatures to see around this large table coral : oriental sweetlips, parrotfish , batfish, and even a beautifully-patterned nudibranch. To know more about the creatures marked out in bold lettering, turn to the back section of this book. This trumpetfish changed colour to try and blend in with a school of yellow tang, but you can pick him out easily enough, cant you? Its a good thing we kept a safe distance from this lionfish. The spines on his back can be quite poisonous! These clownfish carefully guarded their sea anemone home, but finally agreed to let me take a few pictures. We saw a honeycomb moray eel having its teeth cleaned by cleaner wrasses , and another pair even offered to give us a scrub! There were triggerfish and sea urchins. We even saw a coral grouper and a reef octopus playing hide-and-seek. The octopus won the game. Theyre masters of disguise. Pipefish are great at disguise too. Can you spot the two ghost pipefish in this picture? We came across a couple of whitetip reef sharks resting near the bottom. Theyre pretty harmless, so we swam in for a closer look. We followed this hawksbill turtle for a while as he looked around the reef for a nice sea sponge to lunch on. As we made our way back to the boat, we were thrilled to see a manta ray flying through the water with two remora fish in tow. And just when we thought this dive couldnt possibly get any better, we sighted a dugong grazing on some sea grass. What an incredible experience! I cant wait to go diving again! Corals are both plants and animals. Thousands of little algae live inside corals, and give them energy to grow. They have hard outer skeletons and grow into many different shapes. Plankton is the main source of food for many sea creatures. They are a mix of algae, bacteria, tiny animals, and the eggs and larvae of larger animals that float about with the ocean currents. Feather stars may look like plants, but theyre really animals. They use their feather-like arms to catch and eat bits of floating plankton. Parrotfish have strong teeth that form a parrot-like beak, which they use to scrape algae off hard coral. Some species dont mind eating bits of coral as well, and they later poop out a fine sand that washes up on land to form beautiful white beaches. Clownfish and sea anemones live together and help each other. The clownfish help the anemones by cleaning their tentacles and luring other fish for the anemone to eat. The anemones, in turn, allow the clownfish to hide among their poisonous tentacles without stinging them. Cleaner wrasses are small fish that keep bigger fish clean by feeding on their parasites and dead skin. The bigger fish recognise the wrasses by their colours and the dance-like way they move. The reef octopus can hide by changing its colour and texture. It makes its home in holes in the reef, or buries itself in the sand. Ghost pipefish can be found in pairs, floating with their heads down and hidden among sea grass, corals or feather stars. Like the reef octopus, they can change colour to blend in perfectly. The whitetip reef shark has a thin body, broad head, and white tips on its dorsal and tail fin. They hunt at night, and sleep through most of the day. The hawksbill turtle has a flat body, a shell with jagged edges, and a sharp, curving mouth that looks like a hawks beak. Manta rays are huge fish with wing-like fins on the sides of their bodies. These large fins help them swim gracefully through the water. On some manta rays, the distance from one wing tip to the other can reach up to 23 feet! The dugong is a vegetarian marine mammal. Its favourite food is sea grass, which it is able to graze on with its specially-shaped snout. Dugongs are also called sea cows.'}"

Sakuland was a wonderful country. It stretched from the shores of the sea to the forests, from the valleys to the mountain. The animals loved Sakuland. There was grass for the rabbits and the deer, insects for the birds and the bears to snack on, and fish for the crocodiles and wild cats. There was clear, cool water for everyone. Una lived high above the others, on top of a mountain. The climb up and down the rocky mountain trails was long and difficult. She didnt spend too much time with the other animals, and got used to being alone. She rather liked it she could do whatever she wanted, whenever she wanted. Sometimes Una thought that the others were a bit silly. Why do they always have to do everything together? Cant they go to the stream by themselves? I do , thought Una. All the animals had ways they liked to do things. But Una thought her ways were the best. Slowly, Sakulands climate began to change, but the animals werent really paying attention. One day, the whales who spent most of the year in Sakulands waters announced that they were going to live someplace else. Why? asked the turtles. Its quite nice here. The water has become a bit too warm for us, said the whales. We will have to go further north where its cooler. The whales liked to live in cool waters and Sakulands water was now too warm. The turtles would miss the beautiful songs sung by the whales. But they didnt think too much about it. At least Im okay , the turtles thought. Picky, picky, muttered Una to herself. I dont mind if its too hot or cold! They should be more like me. Everyone soon forgot about the whales. But one day, the turtles started to pack up and leave. Why? asked the wild cats. You always seemed happy here. Theres hardly enough sand left for us, said the turtles, who laid their eggs on the sandy beach. Where did it go? asked the wild cats. All we know is that the sand used to reach to the big rock, said the big, old turtle. But the big rock doesnt look so big now the water has almost covered it. Too bad for the turtles. But at least Im okay, thought the wild cats. Una saw the turtles leave and thought, What difference does it make to me if the sand disappears under water? The turtles should have been smart like me when deciding where to live. Una went looking for some grass to snack on and forgot about the whole matter. Then the wild cats left. They couldnt catch nice fish anymore in the stream. It had become just a trickle. The deer thought, Oh, how terrible for the wild cats. But at least Im okay. Una looked over at the stream where she drank. The wild cats are pretty tough, but they must not be as tough as me. One day, Una noticed something strange. Every year, the snow on her mountain would melt, just like an ice cube, and fill up her stream. But now there was less snow. Una wasnt quite certain and thought, Maybe it just looks that way today. But then strange animals began to come to Sakuland. Everyone tried to be friendly to the cows. But the newcomers didnt take much notice they kept munching the grass and chewing it and chewing it some more. And there were so many of them! The deer were not too happy when the grass began to disappear. Slowly, the deer had to go outside Sakuland to find enough of the grass they liked. Hmmm... they should see what I have to eat at times, thought Una. Sometimes I have to lick the lichens on rocks. Not pleasant at all. Una stayed on her mountain as long as she could, but she often found herself, without enough to eat or drink. Finally, hungry and thirsty, Una climbed down the difficult mountain path. She tasted some of the grass from the hills, but it wasnt the kind she liked. She found a stream in a valley, but the waters taste was not as crisp as she was used to. Now Una realised why the other animals had left its very important to eat the food that suits you best and have water nearby. The animals she knew had left Sakuland when they couldnt find their favourite food easily, or when they were too thirsty because the stream had slowed down to a muddy trickle, or when their home trees were cut down to build homes for others. Una and her friends thought at least its not me when changes affected someone else. As the oceans became warmer, the whales left in search for a more suitable home. The turtles, the deer, and Una couldnt care less. But later, they had to admit now it IS me . Una had to admit that having friends nearby is a necessity. She was determined to go find the others. At least its not me Una and her friends who live in Sakuland are facing climate change, just like we are. Human beings are burning more and more Green Houses Gases (GHG) theres carbon dioxide from coal and oil. Carbon dioxide is also released when we cut trees, then methane which cows that live in farms burp out, and nitrous oxides from cars and other vehicles. These Green House Gases are added to the atmosphere and that is causing global warming and changing the climate. As more heat is trapped in the atmosphere by the GHGs, the ice in the poles is melting and sea levels are rising. All of that means that the weather is becoming more unpredictable its cold in the summer and warm in the winter, and the rains dont come on time, like they used to. And that is climate change. Because of Climate Change When forests are cut down, they add to the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere. Animals also lose their homes, the forest, and they have to go to far-off places in search of food. Farmers are not able to grow their crops properly because of erratic rainfall. Often, they sow the seeds but theres no rain, and their crops fail. Imagine a world without mango or chocolate because there was no rain or too much rain and the crop failed! Unpredictable weather also affects human beings. For example, during storms, floods, or droughts, people lose their homes. The pollution in the atmosphere affects our health and we fall ill more often. Climate change affects humans, earth, and all its creatures.'}"

We use them every day. To count, measure, call friends on the phone and even to find out what something costs. But did you know you can also use numbers to create patterns - geometrical shapes, rangoli designs, and more? Did you know number patterns can be seen within patterns in nature? But first, what is a 'Number Pattern'? A Number Pattern is a sequence of numbers where each number is connected to the previous one in ONE specific way. Take this very simple number pattern: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4... How is each number in this sequence connected to the one before it? Well, every number in this sequence is the previous number with 1 ADDED to it. Here's another number pattern: 14,12,10, 8, 6... Each number in this sequence is the previous number with 2 SUBTRACTED from it. Now for a slightly more tricky pattern: 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15... How does this sequence work? Let's see. 0 1 1 1 2 3 3 3 6 6 4 10 10 5 15 Do you see the pattern here? What will the next number in this sequence be? Yes, 21, because 15 6 21. Now, lets take the 'number pattern' we just discussed: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15... , and see if we can create a 'SHAPE pattern' from it. We can! We now have a 'shape pattern' of triangles that get bigger and bigger as we increase the number of dots according to our number pattern! A number pattern has become a shape pattern! If you found that interesting, it's time you were introduced to a beautiful number sequence called the Fibonacci (or Hemachandra) Sequence of numbers. The Fibonacci Sequence of numbers goes like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34... Can you find the pattern that connects these numbers? Yes! Every number in the Fibonacci Sequence is the sum of the two numbers before it! Like this. 01 1 11 2 21 3 32 5 53 8 85 13 138 21 2113 34 Got it? Good. Now for the REALLY interesting part - linking this number pattern to patterns in nature. The number of petals flowers have are often linked to Fibonacci numbers! Can you think of flowers with 1, 3 and 5 petals? (These are all Fibonacci numbers.) Here are some examples to help you along. 1 petal - 1. Anthurium; 2. Calla lilies 3 petals - 3. Bougainvillea; 4. Clovers 5 petals - 5. Temple tree; 6. Hibiscus; 7. Jasmine Flowers with 2 petals are not very common. The Crown of Thorns, which you see here, is one example. Flowers with 4 petals (4 is NOT a Fibonacci number) are also rare. Count the petals of flowers that you come across and see for yourself! The most interesting flower of all, where the Fibonacci sequence is concerned, is the daisy. Different daisy species have 13, 21, or 34 petals - which are all Fibonacci Numbers! There are even more complex and stunning patterns in nature that appear to be based on the Fibonacci numbers. If you are willing to do a little math, you can see it for yourself. Shall we try it out? Now, what would we get if we squared each of the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence? Fibonacci Sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc. If we 'squared' each of these numbers, we would get: 1 x 1 1 Squared or 1 2 1 2 x 2 2 Squared or 2 2 4 3 x 3 3 Squared or 3 2 9 5 x 5 5 Squared or 5 2 25 8 x 8 8 Squared or 8 2 64 13 x 13 13 Squared or 13 2 169 So the Fibonacci Sequence Squared: 1 4 - 9 25 64 169 - etc. When you multiply a number by itself, the number is 'squared'. Now, just like we converted a number pattern into a shape pattern with the triangles before, let's try to convert the Fibonacci Sequence Squared into a shape pattern. Let's try to DRAW 1 2 , 2 2 , 3 2 and so on. 1 2 is easy enough it is just one square. 2 2 is drawn like this - 2 squares across and 2 squares down. We know that 2 2 4, and there are 4 squares in the figure (we call this figure a 'grid'). Similarly, 3 2 is drawn as 3 squares across and 3 squares down. Again, we know that 3 2 9, and there are 9 squares in the grid. 5 2 is drawn as 5 squares across and 5 squares down, making a grid with 25 squares, 8 2 as 8 squares across and 8 squares down, making a grid with 64 squares, 13 2 squared is drawn as a grid with 169 squares, and so on. Now, let's push all the grids we've drawn so far towards each other, and arrange them like in the picture. Done? Now draw a smooth curved line from one corner of the smallest grid to its opposite end, as shown in the figure. Now take the same curved line through each of the other grids, from smallest to biggest, from corner to opposite corner, ending with the 13 squared grid. What we get is a lovely spiral pattern. What is the link between this spiral pattern created by squared Fibonacci numbers, and nature? Well, the exact same Fibonacci Spiral can be found in nature! Where? Let's see, shall we? Here's the Fibonacci Spiral with one more grid - 21 2 - added to our original figure. See how the spiral continues? Does the spiral look familiar? Of course it does! You can see the Fibonacci spiral in seashells (although you might have to twist your head around a bit to see the exact spiral pattern of the previous page)... ... snail shells ... even eggs (see how this spiral goes the other way (anti-clockwise) as compared to the clockwise spiral on page 14?)! Even larger structures like hurricanes and even some galaxies seem to follow the Fibonacci Spiral pattern. Fascinating, isnt it? A BRIEF HISTORY To end this exciting tale of Fibonacci Numbers, let's touch briefly upon the history of the Fibonacci Number Sequence. In the 11th century (almost 1000 years ago), a Jain scholar and monk called Hemachandra, who lived in present-day Gujarat, discovered an interesting mathematical pattern while studying poetry and music. He was looking at the number of different ways in which you could combine 'long' and 'short' sounds in music to create different rhythmic patterns. Around 100 years later, an Italian mathematician called Leonardo Fibonacci (c.1170 c.1250) wrote about the very same mathematical pattern in his book Liber Abaci, or 'Book of Calculation' in 1202. Fibonacci travelled extensively along the Mediterranean coast, meeting merchants from the East and finding out about how they did mathematics. It is possible that Fibonacci came across Hemachandra's sequence during his travels, but since he was the first one to introduce it to Europe, these numbers became known to the world as the Fibonacci Sequence. A word of caution: Although there are many examples in nature that seem to follow the Fibonacci pattern, there are also many examples in nature that do not like four leaved clovers, or flowers with 4 petals. What's intriguing, though, is how often these Fibonacci Numbers do appear in nature. So far, scientists haven't figured out WHY nature seems to love Fibonacci numbers so much. Maybe YOU can find the answer when you grow up!""}"

It was Muttajji\'s birthday and they had a train to catch! Muttajji, who was the twins\' mother\'s mother\'s mother, lived in Mysore with Ajji, who was the twins\' mother\'s mother. No one actually knew when Muttajji\'s birthday was; Ajji had always celebrated it on the Makara Sankranthi holiday. ""Amma, will there be a cake?"" asked Putti. ""A big, spongy cake with pink icing and a rose on top?"" ""Naah,"" said Putta. ""Old people don\'t have birthday cakes. And 200 candles won\'t fit on any cake."" ""Muttajji isn\'t 200 years old, silly,"" said Putti. ""How old is Muttajji, Amma?"" Amma smiled. ""Why don\'t you ask her when we get there?"" The moment they reached the old green house in Mysore, the twins burst into Muttajji\'s room. ""Happy birthday, Muttajji! How old are you today?"" Muttajji hugged the twins. ""How old am I? Who knows? How does it matter?"" ""But it does!"" cried Putta and Putti together. Muttajji smiled. ""Well,"" she said, ""I know that around five years before I was born, our Maharaja went to a grand party for Indian Maharajas and Maharanis in Delhi. A British king and queen had come to visit, and our Maharaja got a gold medal."" ""Oooh! A party! There must have been lots of cake!"" said Putti. ""Who was this king, Muttajji? If you know, we can find out which year he visited. if we add five years to that, we will know when YOU were born!"" Muttajji shrugged. ""I\'ve forgotten, Putta."" Putta\'s face fell. ""Wait,"" said Muttajji. ""Let me see if I can remember something else. Aaaan! When I was about your age - nine or ten - my uncle from Bombay visited us and told us about clean trains."" ""Clean trains?"" ""Yes!"" Muttajji was excited. ""They had started running in Bombay that year. You never got dirty travelling in them. No black dust on your clothes and face, no grime, nothing!"" The twins stared at her. Why would anyone get dirty travelling by train? ""Some years later,"" continued Muttajji, ""I got married. The law was that a girl should be at least 15 before she was married, and my father would never break the law, so I must have been 16 then. Very soon after my marriage, your Muttajja got a job in Bombay, and we left Mysore."" ""Did anything important happen the year you got married, Muttajji?"" asked Putta. ""Yes,"" said Muttajji sadly. ""Our Maharaja inaugurated our big dam, and the beautiful gardens next to it, during the Dasara festival that year. But I missed it; I was in Bombay. "" ""A big dam?"" Putta sat up. ""Is it still there?"" Muttajji hooted with laughter. ""Of course! Rock-solid too. It was the dam that tamed the Kaveri. No more floods in the monsoon, and enough water for the fields in the summer."" Ajji put her head around the door. ""Are you talking about KRS, Amma?"" ""Aaaan, KRS,"" Muttajji said, looking fondly at Ajji. ""Your Ajji was my fifth child, the youngest, but always the smartest. Do you know, twins, my children came like clockwork, one every two monsoons. The day your Ajji decided to come out, your Muttajja could not be found. Later, he told us that he had gone to see Gandhiji give a speech at the Gowalia Tank Maidan. He was so excited. \'Quit India!\' he kept shouting the whole day, silly man, disturbing the baby.\' ""Quit India!"" Putti\'s eyes grew round with excitement. ""We studied it in history, Putta! The movement started in 1942! That means 1942 was the year that... "" ""...Ajji was born,"" pouted Putta. ""Not Muttajji."" ""That\'s a start!"" said Putti. ""Which year were you born, Ajji?"" ""I will be 74 this year,"" said Ajji. ""So I was born in?"" Putti quickly did the calculations. ""1942!"" she said. Ajji nodded. ( 2016 - 74 1942 ) ""Now, Ajji is Muttajji\'s fifth child and all her kids were two years apart!"" said Putta. ""So if Ajji was born in 1942..."" ""...Muttajji\'s fourth child was born in 1942 - 2 1940, the third in 1940 - 2 1938, the second in 1938 - 2 1936, and the first in 1936 - 2 1934."" ""So Muttajji was married in 1932!"" cried Putti. ""Not necessarily,"" said Putta. ""Muttajji didn\'t say her first child was born two years after her marriage. She only said a dam was built in Mysore the year she got married."" ""Maybe this will help, twins,"" said Ajji, bringing in bowls of vermicelli payasa, Muttajji\'s favourite sweet dish. ""KRS is the Krishnarajasagar Dam. The Brindavan Gardens are the gardens attached to it. We went there last year to see the musical fountains, remember?"" The twins nodded. ""Mmmm,"" said Putti. ""Your payasa is the BEST, Ajji!"" ""When was KRS built, do you know, Ajji?"" Ajji shook her head. ""I\'m not sure. But you can go with Ajja to the central library after lunch and find out there."" In the library, Putti found a book on the history of Mysore. ""Here it is!"" she whispered. "" Two of Mysore\'s most visited tourist spots, the KRS Dam and the adjacent Brindavan Gardens, were opened to the public in 1932 .\'"" The twins grinned - that meant Muttajji had indeed married in 1932, 84 years ago! (2016 - 1932 84) ""Muttajji thinks she was 16 when she got married,"" said Putti, ""but she could have been 15 or 17 or 18."" ""She also said she was about 9 or 10 when her Bombay uncle told her about the \'clean\' train,"" said Putta. ""Ajja may know what that means."" Ajja was in the reading room. ""Ajja,"" whispered Putti, ""in the olden days, did people get dirty travelling by train?"" Ajja nodded. ""There were steam engines then, which ran on coal, not electricity,"" he said. ""Black coal dust used to fly out of the chimney and land on everyone and everything. Terrible!"" ""That\'s it, Putti!"" hissed Putta.""Electric trains were the \'clean\' trains!"" He pulled out a book on the Indian Railways. ""It says here,"" he pointed, ""that India\'s first electric train came to Bombay in 1925!"" ""And Muttajji says she was about 9 then,"" said Putta. ""If she is right, then Muttajji was born in 1916. "" ""But she could be wrong, you know,"" frowned Putti. ""Only one way to make sure,"" said Putta. ""We have to find out if that big party for kings and queens in Delhi, which Muttajji said happened five years before she was born, happened in 1911."" They ran back to Ajja. (1925-9 1916 ); (1916 -5 1911) ""Ajja, was there a grand party for a foreign king who visited India around 1911?"" Ajja frowned. ""1911? Why is that date so familiar? Aaan yes. It was the year the Gateway of India was built in Bombay. And yes, it was built to welcome the British Emperor of India, George V! There must have been several grand parties, not one."" Ajja tapped his forehead, looking very pleased with himself. ""Not bad for an old brain, eh?"" ""Not bad at all!"" cried the twins. ""Thanks, Ajja!"" They knew exactly how old Muttajji was! Five minutes later, the twins were racing homewards. ""Muttajji, "" they panted, rushing straight to her room, ""did the Mysore Maharaja get his gold medal from King George V?"" ""Aaaaaan!"" Muttajji said happily. ""That\'s it! George! What clever children you are!"" ""That means, Muttajji, that you were born in 1916! You are exactly 100 years old today!"" (2016 - 1916 100) ""That\'s great detective work, twins!"" smiled Amma. ""I think you - and Muttajji - deserve a special treat. A big, spongy one, with pink icing, and a rose on top."" ""Hurrayyyyyy!"" cheered the twins. The Grand Maharaja-Maharani Party (and other fun stuff from Indian history) Remember all the important historical events Muttajji talked about in the story? They all really happened! Here is a little more information about them. The Grand Maharaja-Maharani Party (1911 ) - When the British Emperor George V and his wife Queen Mary visited India for the first time, they hosted a grand party for over 400 Indian kings and queens. It was called the Delhi Durbar. To feed 200,000 guests, bakeries put out 20000 loaves of bread a day, and over 1000 cattle and sheep were slaughtered for every meal! Many Indian rulers received gold medals from the Emperor, including the Maharaja of Mysore, Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV. The Clean Trains (1925) - On Feb 3, 1925, India\'s first electric train left Bombay\'s Victoria Terminus for Kurla station. With that, India became the 3rd country in Asia and only the 24th in the world to introduce railway electrification. The Dam That Tamed The Kaveri (1932) - The Kaveri river runs through southern Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The river was always a blessing, keeping Mysore fertile, but, like every other river, it used to flood in the monsoons and run dry in the summer. All that changed when a dam was built across the river and the Krishna Raja Sagara (KRS) reservoir created. The reservoir still provides most of the drinking water for Bangalore city. Gandhiji\'s Big Speech (1942) - The \'Quit India Speech\' was a speech made by Gandhiji on 8 August 1942, at the Gowalia Tank Maidan in Bombay. Gandhiji asked people to fight against British rule not by using violence, but by disobeying their laws. Five years later, on August 15, 1947, the non-violent war got the results Gandhiji wanted - the British left, and India became independent. Today, the Gowalia Tank Maidan is called the August Kranti Maidan in memory of that peaceful revolution.'}"

Dida and Pia move closer to Apu to listen. ""Bey-asura LOVED to sing, but his fellow asuras HATED his voice,"" says Apu. ""So they sent him away to the top of the mountain, where no one could hear him sing."" Apu climbs up on Didas big bed, pretending it is a tall mountain. In his scariest asura voice, Apu as Bey-asura begins to sing. ""\' Saaaaaaa \' Bey-asura began, warming up. \' Rayyyyyyyyy. \' he sang louder. The suns rays dimmed a little in alarm. \' Gaaaaaa. \' he yelled even louder. Bey-asura was feeling happy now. So he decided to do some Kathak dance."" "" \' Dha-dhin-dhin-dha ,\' Bey-asura kept time, stamped his feet and twirled. Feeling more and more happy, he sang along, \' Maaaaaa Paaaaa. \' The mountain, which had been sleeping in peace, woke up, all frightened. The asuras singing and dancing made the mountain tremble. KABOOM! Fell the rocks. DHADAAAAM! The rocks shook the Earth."" ""Do you know what happened when the rocks fell?"" Apu asks his audience. Dida shakes her head, with a naughty smile. ""I will tell you what happened,"" Apu says. ""The earth shook! As the mountain trembled, everything started moving. Even Bey-asura, a gigantic giant, swayed from side to side!"" ""The earth swung this way"" says Apu, rolling on the floor. ""Then it swung the other way."" Apu rolls some more. Just then, the earth actually starts to move! The bed shakes just like the mountain in Bey-asuras story. ""Apu, stop singing!"" yells Pia. ""You are frightening the mountain."" ""Its not me,"" says Apu. ""The whole room is shaking."" Dida, Apu and Pia fall silent. Even Bholu doesnt bark. Then, there is another bigger jolt. ""The floor is shaking!"" yells Apu. ""Its all Bey-asuras fault!"" cries Pia. ""No, no,"" says Dida, calmly. ""It is an earthquake."" ""Theres no time to run outside. Quick, go under the bed,"" says Dida. They all sit under Didas tall bed and hold on to its legs. But the earth continues to shake. TUMBLE! The dolls on the shelf shake and fall. SPLASH SPLASH! The water in the jug starts splashing around. ""Whoooa!"" Apu yells as he feels the floor shake. ""Aaaaoooo!"" whimpers Bholu. Apus stomach feels like Bey-asura is stomping inside it. Finally, the shaking stops. Dida waits for two minutes to see if it starts again. But now the earth is firm. It has stopped quaking! They all crawl out from under the bed. ""We can go outside now,"" says Dida. ""Shouldnt we have run out?"" asks Apu. ""Only if you are near an exit,"" says Dida. ""If you are upstairs and in a strong building, you should go under the bed or a sturdy table and hold on so it does not move away from you. If there is nothing, go to a corner of the room and stay away from windows, doors and anything that can fall like light bulbs and fans."" Apu, Dida, Pia, and Bholu go out of their house. Some of the flower pots have fallen and are smashed. A crack has appeared on the outside wall of their house. People are standing on the road, talking to each other. Is it safe to go back indoors? Apu picks up a fallen plant. He puts his hand on the earth. ""Bey-asura will sing softly next time,"" he promises the earth. Did Bey-asura really make the earth shake with his singing? No, earthquakes have been occurring ever since the earth was formed, even when it was a really young planet. The top layer of the earth, the one that we can see, is called the crust . Underneath it is another layer called the mantle. T hen there is the inner and outer core . The crust is made up of tectonic plates that glide over the mantle, and move very slowly and rub against each other. Sometimes, the plates get caught against each other. Then the plates are not able to slide as they usually do and tension builds up. When the plates suddenly move away, energy waves are released. This makes the earth quake as the waves travel through the ground. And thats how an earthquake happens! The spot where the plates move apart is called the focus . The place on the earth right above the focus is called the epicenter . Layers of the Earth The layers mentioned here are shown in the picture on the left. 1. Crust 2. Mantle 3. Core Earthquakes are measured on a scale called the Richter Scale that ranges from 1-3 (small, very less damage), 4-6 (moderate), 7-10 (very severe). The instrument that measures earthquakes is called a seismograph (shown as 4 in the picture) . Where in India and the world can earthquakes happen? The tectonic plates run under the surface of the earth throughout the globe and have been mapped by scientists. In India, the most earthquake-prone areas are Kashmir, the middle and central Himalayas, the north-eastern states, parts of Bihar and the Rann of Kutch. Places like Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Maharashtra, Andaman and Nicobar Islands also get earthquakes often. More earthquakes happen here because the Indian land mass is moving and pushing against Asia. Places where earthquakes strike often are called high seismic zones (shown on pg 21) . Some other places around the world that have seen devastating earthquakes are Japan, Indonesia, Italy, Turkey, Chile, Alaska and California in the United States. What to do if you are in an earthquake 1. Dont panic. 2. If you are indoors and in a high rise building or a building that is strong, drop to the ground and take cover under a bed or a sturdy table, and hold on. Stay away from objects that can break away from the walls and fall on you. Do not go near a door unless it is very strong. 3. If you are near an exit or in an old, unsteady building, move out quickly and calmly. 4. If you are outside during the earthquake, find an open spot away from buildings, streetlights and walls, and stay there. 5. If you are on a steep hillside, move away from the side of the hill in case of landslides and falling rocks.'}"

""It isn\'t going anywhere."" ""But Rani is! To a wedding! In the afternoon..."" Jiya stopped suddenly. Ammi roared with laughter. ""I knew you two rascals had planned this together!"" Rani was Jiya\'s neighbour. She was only five, and she adored eight-year-old Jiya. Jiya wondered how Ammi had known their secret. ""Ammi magic!"" winked Ammi. She didn\'t tell Jiya that she and Rani\'s Amma had made their own plans for the Mela. Ammis have secrets too. The Big Mela was as wonderful as ever. But Rani\'s eyes and nose were only searching for one thing. ""Jiya didi, I can smell it now!"" Rani was very excited. ""Rafiq Kaka\'s Famous Mutton Biryani and More Famous Gulab Jamoons! I want a WHOLE plate to myself! May I, pleeeeease?"" Jiya laughed. ""A WHOLE plate? Your eyes are bigger than your little stomach, Rani!"" Jiya counted out her money. She only had enough for one plate of biryani and one plate of gulab jamoons. But Rani looked so eager that Jiya didn\'t have the heart to tell her. ""Tell you what, Rani!"" she said. ""We\'ll do a One-by-Two."" ""One-by-Two? What\'s that?"" ""You\'ll see,"" said Jiya. ""One plate of Famous Biryani, please, Rafiq Kaka!"" Jiya emptied her purse onto the counter. ""ONE plate?"" protested Rani. ""I thought we were getting one EACH!"" ""One-by-Two is more fun!"" said Jiya. ""That\'s right!"" said Rafiq Kaka, heaping a plate with biryani. He cut a big piece of mutton in half and popped both pieces on top of the rice. Then he filled a bowl with jamoons, six instead of the usual four. ""Thanks, Rafiq Kaka,"" Jiya smiled gratefully at him. Rani had had enough. ""What\'s a One-by-Two, didi? Tell me NOW!"" Jiya put one piece of mutton on Rani\'s plate and one on hers. ""One-by-Two means that we take ONE thing and share it equally between the TWO of us,"" she said. ""I like that,"" said Rani. ""It\'s a fair way to share. But how do we do it, didi?"" ""We draw a line right through the centre of the plate to make 1 plate of biryani into 2 equal parts. You get one part, and I get the other part, like this. One-by-Two. Same-same."" Five minutes later, the girls had wiped their plates clean. ""Yum!"" said Rani. ""I\'m stuffed!"" ""What about the One-by-Two for the jamoons?"" said Jiya. ""Oh yes! I want to draw the line in the middle!"" said Rani. Rani drew a line through the sugar syrup with her spoon. But every time she moved her spoon away, the jamoons simply floated back into the centre of the bowl. ""This isn\'t working, didi,"" she said sadly. ""We can\'t do a One-by-Two with the jamoons."" Jiya laughed. ""Of course we can,"" she said. ""We just do it a different way."" ""Let\'s put one here for you,"" Jiya put a jamoon in Rani\'s bowl, ""and one there for me. And now we do the same with the syrup. One spoonful for you, and one for me."" ""Okay,"" said Rani. ""What next?"" ""We do it again,"" said Jiya. ""One for Rani, one for Jiya. And we keep doing that until all the jamoons and all the syrup are gone."" ""Can I do it now?"" said Rani, eyes shining. ""One here, one there. And now there are no more jamoons left. One-by-Two!"" ""Not so fast,"" said Jiya. ""One-by-Two means dividing a thing into two EQUAL parts. Are you sure we have shared the jamoons equally, Rani?"" Rani shook her head. ""Let\'s find out,"" said Jiya. ""Count how many jamoons you have, and how many I have."" ""I have 1,2,3... 3 jamoons, and you have 1,2,3... 3 jamoons. That means,"" Rani was excited now, ""we have shared the jamoons EQUALLY! We have a One-by-Two! And we didn\'t even draw a line in the middle!"" Jiya laughed. ""Yes, you got ONE of TWO equal parts, and I got ONE of TWO equal parts. ONE by TWO!"" ""Hurray!"" said Rani. ""Can we eat now?"" They grinned at each other through a mouthful of yummy jamoons. ""Did you girls have fun?"" asked Rani\'s Amma. ""Yes, Amma!"" Rani hugged her mother. ""I learned how to turn ONE into TWO."" ""One into two?"" Ammi looked puzzled. ""I don\'t understand."" Jiya and Rani giggled. ""That\'s okay, Ammi,"" winked Jiya. ""It\'s a secret."" Learning to share What if Rani\'s friend Raju had joined Jiya and Rani? Would a One-by-Two have worked then? No, of course it wouldn\'t. Jiya would have had to do a different trick, called a One-by-Three, where she divided ONE thing into THREE equal parts. What if Ammi had joined them and they still had only one plate of biryani to share? Well, Jiya would have simply performed the One-by-Four, where she would have divided the ONE plate of biryani into FOUR equal parts. There is a name in mathematics for the trick of dividing something into many equal parts. The trick is called Fractions . Fractions are wonderful because they help you share things equally and fairly. In maths: The one-by-two fraction is written as 12 . Another name for One-by-Two is Half . The one-by-three fraction is written as 13 . Another name for it is One-third. The one-by-four fraction is written as 14. Another name for it is a Quarter . Think about it: How would you do a One-by-Two with a dosa? Would you draw a line through the centre with a knife or use the \'one here-one there\' method? What if Rafiq Kaka had given the girls seven jamoons? How would they have done a One-by-Two then? What method would you use to do a One-by-Two with: A bowl of sweets A glass of sugarcane juice'}"

Papa bent down and lovingly nudged Ghum-Ghum. ""Welcome home, Ghum-Ghum!"" said Papa. ""Where did you go off to?"" ""I went on a glorious adventure!"" said Ghum-Ghum, giggling. ""And tomorrow, I want to go again!"" Ghum-Ghum lives by the great river Ganga with her big, noisy family of gharials. She goes swimming every day, to catch insects and fish for her lunch. Ghum-Ghum meets all kinds of creatures on her daily swims: dolphins, otters, snails, water birds, fishermen in boats, buffaloes, snakes, and many others. How many of Ghum-Ghum\'s river friends can you spot in this page and the next?'}"

Ranjita raced to the other side of the room. She returned in an instant with the two coconuts. Amma was pleased. ""Thank you, darling! You are such a help."" Ranjita glowed with pride. It was a BIG day today - her uncle Mahesh Chikkappa\'s wedding! And she had a BIG responsibility - to hand over mithai boxes to the 100 guests after lunch. But where were the mithai boxes? ""Oh no!"" cried Amma. ""The boxes are still in the room upstairs! Run and bring them down quickly, Ranju. The guests have almost finished their lunch."" ""Amma, you never ask ME for help!"" said a small, whiny voice. ""And I\'m hungry."" ""You can help Akka, Vikky,"" said Amma soothingly. ""Ranju, take him with you, please?"" Ranjita frowned. Why did Amma always do this? Her little brother Vikram was SO annoying! But there was no time to argue. ""You have to listen to me and do exactly as I say, Vikky!"" she warned him, making her eyes big and stern. Vikram nodded. ""I will, Akka! Promise!"" The two of them ran to the room upstairs. Upstairs, in a corner, were a pile of cloth bags. Ranjita pulled open a bag. There were several small mithai boxes inside. ""It will take too long to empty all the bags and count out 100 boxes, Akka!"" Vikram was very worried. ""And I\'m very hungry."" ""Shhhh!"" said Ranjita fiercely. ""Let me think!"" Ranjita thought hard. Vikram was right. It would take too long to actually count out 100 boxes. They couldn\'t take all the bags down either. There were too many of them. Vikram looked longingly at the mithai boxes. ""Can I open one? I\'m VERY hungry."" ""NO!"" said Ranjita. Then she smiled. ""Idea! We dont need to take EXACTLY 100 mithai boxes! We can take APPROXIMATELY 100. That will be much quicker."" ""Approximately?"" Vikram looked puzzled. ""What does that mean, Akka?"" ""It means a few MORE than, or a few LESS than, the exact number,"" said Ranjita. ""Bu-ut,"" Vikram said slowly, ""If we take less than 100, there won\'t be enough for everyone."" ""So we take more!"" said Ranjita. ""Ok, lets do it!"" Vikram grabbed a few bags. ""Quick! I\'m very, VERY hungry!"" ""Wait, silly! Let me tell you HOW to approximate first!"" said Ranjita. She poured out all the boxes from one bag onto the floor and counted them. ""See, Vikky,"" she said. ""There are 10 mithai boxes in this bag."" Vikram nodded. Ranjita pointed to the other bags. ""All the bags are approximately, more or less, the same size. What does that tell you?"" Vikram shrugged. ""It tells you that each bag has approximately, more or less, 10 mithai boxes!"" said Ranjita. ""Oh THAT!"" said Vikram airily. ""I knew THAT."" Ranjita hid her grin. ""Tell me this, then. How many mithai boxes in two bags?"" ""Approximately-more-or-less 20,"" said Vikram instantly. ""And in three bags?"" ""Approximately-more-or-less 30!"" Vikram began to smile. He was getting the hang of this. ""And in five?"" ""Approximately-more-or-less 50!"" yelled Vikram. ""And 50 is half of all the mithai boxes we need!"" (10 x 2 20), (10 x 3 30) (10 x 5 50) (Half of 100 100 2 50) ""That\'s very good, Vikky!"" said Ranju admiringly. Vikram turned red with delight. He loved it when his Akka praised him. ""Now can I open a mithai..."" Ranjita glared. ""I mean,"" Vikram said quickly, ""I will take 5 bags with approximately-more-or-less 50 boxes, and you take 5. Okay?"" ""Not so fast!"" said Ranjita. ""We haven\'t counted the boxes in every bag. What if one or two bags have only 8 boxes? We won\'t have enough for everyone then."" Vikram paused. As usual, Akka was right. ""So we take 11 bags, then?"" he asked slowly. ""With approximately-more-or-less 110 mithai boxes?"" ""Exactly!"" said Ranjita. ""You take 5 bags, and I will take 6. Come on!"" The children ran down the stairs with the bags. Amma was waiting anxiously. She was very relieved to see them. ""That was quick!"" said Amma. ""Are you sure we have enough for everyone?"" ""Yes, Amma,"" said Vikky. ""I am very, very sure. AND... I\'m very, very, VERY hungry."" When all the guests had left, Amma hugged Ranjita and Vikram. ""You both saved the day!"" she said. Then she narrowed her eyes. ""I\'ve never seen you both work so well together,"" she said. ""Does that mean you finally like each other?"" Ranjita and Vikram laughed. ""Approximately-more-or-less!"" they said, as they ran to lunch. THE GUESSING GAME Ranjita and Vikram used a clever mathematical trick to get their job done quickly. They called it \'Approximately More or Less\'; mathematicians call it \'Estimation\'. So what is Estimation? Is it like guessing? Sort of, but estimation is \'intelligent\' guessing. Why is estimation important? Estimation helps you identify wrong answers quickly. For instance, let\'s say you have just 30 seconds to answer this question: 1. What is 17 x 9? a. 172 b. 153 c. 186 d. 89 You know that 17 x 10 170 (anything into ten is the same number with a zero at the end). So 17 x 9 should be LESS than that. That means Options (a) and (c) are wrong. Option (d) seems too small to be the right answer - 17 x 9 should be closer to 170. So you pick Option (b). See how estimation has helped you pick the right option, simply by identifying the wrong ones? Estimation helps alert you to real-life errors. When the shopkeeper totals your bill, you can tell instantly if it is wrong because you have estimated approximately how much it should be. Estimation helps you calculate distances. If you know that you cover 30 cm with each step, and that you take 1800 steps to walk from home to the library, you can estimate the distance between the two (1800 x 30 cm 54000 cms 540 m, which is about half a kilometre). Estimation is fun. How many peas inside half a kilo of unshelled pods? How many elephants should you stand on top of each other to make the height of your flagpole? You can find out answers to all kinds of wacky questions using estimation!'}"

She had brought a BIG present. Ooooh! Knock-knock! Knock, knock! Soon, all NINE guests had arrived. Hurray! ""Let\'s play I Spy!"" said Sania. Sania loved I Spy because she knew how to stay very, very quiet. Once, Maria could not find her for a whole hour! ""The birthday girl should count!"" yelled Priya (who was very bossy). Knock-knock!

""I spy Rohan AND Aman!"" clapped Sania. How many left to find? FOUR! Sania climbed up to the roof. Something moved behind the water tank. Sania crept closer. ""Hisss!"" The cat shot out, straight into the clothesline. ""Yaaaaaa!"" Mamma\'s saree yelled with fright and fell in a heap on the ground. ""I spy Shaan!"" cheered Sania. How many left to find? THREE! ""SHOOO! GO AWAY! NOOOO!"" What was going on? Sania hurried into the garden. Behind the hibiscus bushes, she saw two scared girls and one fat bee. ""I spy Harpreet!"" shouted Sania, running away from the bee. ""And Maria!"" How many left to find? ONE! The smell of the Very Special Pav Bhaji filled the house. Sania\'s stomach began to growl. ""Cake-cutting time, Sania!"" called Mama. ""We are all waiting!"" ""Happy birthday tooo youuuu!"" sang everyone. ""Hello!"" yelled an angry voice. ""You haven\'t found me yet!"" ""I spy Priya!"" Sania tried not to laugh. ""Cake?"" Harpreet giggled. Zoya chuckled. ""How dare you laugh at..."" Priya shook her fist. THUD! She fell out of the loft onto a pile of pillows. Sania did not laugh. She helped Priya up, and cut her a big slice of cake. ""Thank you,"" said Priya. She didn\'t sound bossy anymore. ""Happy birthday, Sania."" Sania smiled. How many left to find? ZERO! TAKE IT AWAY! NINE of Sania\'s friends came to the party. When Jude left, there was ONE LESS THAN NINE, i.e., EIGHT friends. ONE friend was TAKEN AWAY from the group. We can write this as: 9 (friends) - 1 (Jude) 8 (friends left). When there were SIX friends left to find, Sania found Rohan AND Aman. Now there were TWO LESS THAN SIX friends to find. TWO friends were removed, or TAKEN AWAY. We can write this as: 6 (friends) - 2 (Rohan and Aman) 4 (friends left). This \'TAKING AWAY\' of a small number from a bigger number is called SUBTRACTION . But subtraction does not work only with friends. It works just as well with rajma seeds... If you TAKE AWAY 3 rajma seeds from 9, how many are you left with? 9 (seeds) - 3 (seeds) (seeds left) And it works even with rupee coins. If you take away 4 rupee coins from a stack of 8 rupee coins, how many do you have left? 8 (rupees) - 4 (rupees) (rupees left) Isn\'t that amazing?'}"

""That\'s what the green part in the middle is for,"" smiled Sparrow . ""First, let\'s think about how we look,"" said Sparrow. ""Same-same or different?"" ""VERY different,"" sighed Snake. ""I\'m long, hairless and thin. You\'re small, plump and soft."" You\'re right,"" said Sparrow. ""I look like a powder puff,"" she drew a powder puff in the yellow crescent, ""and you look like a rope-so-rough."" She drew a rope in the blue crescent. ""Now,"" she said. ""How do we move?"" ""VERY differently,"" Snake said, looking even sadder. ""You fly through the air, flap-flapping. I slither along the ground, zig-zagging."" ""In other words,"" said Sparrow. ""I move like a plane, and you move like a train."" Snake sighed. ""Cheer up, Snake,"" said Sparrow briskly. ""Let\'s see now, what do we eat?"" ""VERY different things,"" Snake\'s eyes filled with tears. ""But I don\'t eat birds\' eggs."" ""I know,"" said Sparrow soothingly. But now she looked glum too. ""Seeds and grass,"" she muttered, as she drew them in the yellow crescent. ""Frogs and rats,"" she sputtered, and drew them in the blue crescent. ""Harrrrrumph!"" Snake and Sparrow jumped. It was Headmaster Elephant. ""Why the long faces, kids?"" he asked kindly. ""Oh sir,"" sobbed Snake. ""My Pappa and Sparrow\'s Mamma say we can\'t be friends because we are different."" ""We wanted to show them we were more same-same than different, sir,"" said Sparrow. ""But it isn\'t working."" Headmaster Elephant looked at the circles a long time. Then he began to laugh. Snake and Sparrow stared at him. What was so funny? ""Don\'t you see, kids?"" he said finally, wiping his tears. ""You are doing this all wrong! Let me help you."" Headmaster Elephant settled down on a bench. ""Now then, Snake,"" he said, ""what do you like doing best?"" ""Playing and chatting, Sir,"" said Snake. ""ESPECIALLY with Sparrow."" ""And you, Sparrow?"" ""Chatting and playing, Sir,"" said Sparrow. ""ESPECIALLY with Snake."" ""Right,"" said Headmaster Elephant, ""you like doing the SAME things."" And he drew something - in the green part. ""Next,"" said Headmaster Elephant, ""what makes you happy, kids?"" ""When Miss lets me sit next to a friend, Sir,"" Snake began to smile. ""Same-same, Sir,"" clapped Sparrow. A-ha!"" said Headmaster Elephant. ""You both have the SAME happy place. Green!"" ""All right, what makes you sad, Snake and Sparrow?"" ""That Pappa says I should stay away from Sparrow, sir,"" sighed Snake. ""That Mamma says I should stay away from Snake, sir,"" sighed Sparrow. Headmaster Elephant frowned. ""You are both sad,"" he said, ""for the SAME reason - your parents don\'t let you choose your friends. Green again!"" ""Now then,"" said Headmaster Elephant, ""who do you think is the best kind of friend?"" ""Someone who loves you..."" began Snake. ""... even though you are different!"" finished Sparrow. ""So you both agree, said Headmaster Elephant, ""that a true friend loves you no matter what. That makes FOUR \'same-sames\' and only THREE \'differents\'. Same-sames win!"" ""Hurray!"" said Snake and Sparrow. ""Thank you, Headmaster Elephant!"" ""Harrrumph!"" said Headmaster Elephant. ""One last thing..."" ""Yes, sir?"" ""Tell your parents I want to see them in my office. First thing tomorrow morning!"" And Headmaster Elephant marched away, looking very fierce indeed. SORT IT OUT! Sorting and grouping are important skills in mathematics. To sort things, you have to ask yourself \'logic\' questions like: 1. What things are same? What things are different? 2. How are the same things same? How are different things different? 3. Can the same things be sorted and grouped in more than one way? Think about the many ways in which you can sort and group these toy animals. You can sort them: - According to their colour - blue animals in one circle, yellow in another. - According to their size - small animals in one circle, big ones in another. - According to how they move - animals that walk and animals that fly. Would the groups be different each time? Try it and see!'}"

I wake up in the morning And look at what I see! A rocket waiting outside; I try and hide my glee. The rocket is all fired up, My bags are packed and full. 'Whoosh!' it roars and shoots up, Im Astronaut Madam Gul! My cat, she shakes and trembles, My head spins round and round. In just a few minutes, We are way above the ground. Six hours later, here it is My new home in outer space They call it Space Station; Hello, you beautiful place! Boing! we go from step to step, I hardly feel my legs. Before we even know it, We turn down on our heads! And then begins the floating, To the left and to the right. Drifting through the air we go, And twisting to the side. Oops! My bag turns upside down And out come two jalebis. Samosas that I packed so well, I think theyve all gone crazy! They bump around and float across, The crumbs and icky juice. I'll stick to labelled packets, Of these special space foods. My hair is all so sticky, The clothes are such a mess. My cat, she tries to lick me clean; A bath will work the best. But heres a little secret, There are no taps in space. I wet this towel just a bit And wipe it on my face. Then squeeze some shampoo in my hair And rub it through and through. A final proper wiping, My hair looks clean and new. I get into my space suit For a very special day. Come and join me in the fun, Its space walk all the way! Step by step I go outside, A slow and dangerous crawl. Its dark and cold and quiet, Im connected to the walls. The stars are shining clear and bright They look so big and near. The moon just smiles and seems to say 'Happy Birthday, Gul dear.' Its time for me to head back in And get some cosy rest. The space walk was so tiring; That was scary, but the best. This is where I need to sleep, My bed for next few days. What fun it is to squeeze right in And strap myself in place. I wake up after some time, No minute we can waste But first I go and brush my teeth And swallow all the paste! I want to speak to Ammi, My laptop's strapped in place. 'Hello, whos that?' she screams from there, 'Im Gul from outer space!' I tell her of the things Ive done, Of magic that is space. Of how the earth looks far from here, Of this Stations funny ways. I live in space for two full months, Its time to head back soon. Far away we hear some child Wish for journeys to the moon. Raise your hand if that is you And keep your bags all checked. My cat and I return tonight, Itll soon be your turn next. Did You Know? - You need to sit inside a rocket to go into space. There are different kinds of rockets, but the most common one is the kind that Gul and her cat go in. The rocket takes them to the International Space Station (ISS), which is Guls home in space for two months. They use a spacecraft called Soyuz to return to Earth from the ISS. - There are spacecrafts that go from Earth to ISS carrying specially packed food and water, and other things that astronauts need to live there. Gul has to be careful with the use of water inside the space station. Every drop is precious. - Gul and the other objects inside the ISS float like balloons. Anything that is not strapped down will float because they appear to become weightless in space. This happens because the space station itself and everything inside it are falling very fast towards Earth all the time. It is this falling with speed that makes Gul feel weightless. But if they are falling, why doesnt everything not crash on to Earth? Thats because our planet is round, and as the ISS and everything inside it falls down, down, down, the Earths surface curves away from them and they never reach the ground. - There are no taps inside the ISS because water cannot flow down in a weightless environment. So Gul has to use a special shampoo that does not need to be rinsed off, and she also swallows her toothpaste. If Gul leaves a water bag open by mistake, drops of water will start floating all over the space station and combine to form a big ball of water.""}"

They can float around in the air that we breathe, and sit on things we touch. When these viruses get into your nose and throat, they give you a sore throat, or a headache, or a clogged nose -- or even all three at the same time! A cold can move very quickly from you to your friends. If you touch your friends when you have a cold, or sneeze or cough near them, they too will fall sick. Did you know that a single cough or sneeze can shoot your nose and throat viruses 12 feet through the air? How terrible! This is how you can avoid catching a cold: Stay far away from anyone who has a bad cold. If you meet or shake hands with someone who has a cold, wash your hands well. Otherwise, the virus will travel from your hands to your nose. Do not share drinking glasses, eating utensils or clothes with someone who has a cold. Eat lots of vegetables and fruits, drink plenty of water, exercise, keep warm and stay healthy!'}"

Because she had a cloud hanging over her head. A cloud of TRASH. Orange peels and biscuit packets, Broken toys and pencil shavings, Twisted plastic bottles and colourful plastic bags, All surrounded by a swarm of buzzing flies. No one wanted to play with a girl who had a cloud of trash hanging over her. What if a rotten banana peel fell on your head? YUCK! Cheekoo couldnt even play hide-and-seek anymore. The cloud would always give her away. ""Lets walk to school together,"" she said to Sona. Sona ran off in the opposite direction. ""May I borrow your pencil sharpener?"" she asked Sweety. Sweety made a face and changed her seat to go sit with Asha. Cheekoo even had to eat her lunch alone. Cheekoo knew that she should have listened to her Amma. Amma always told her not to litter. ""Dont throw the banana peel on the road!"" ""Throw the empty biscuit packet in the dustbin."" But Cheekoo never listened. She only laughed and kept littering. Then one day, Amma became very angry. ""Soon, all this trash will start following you!"" she said. Cheekoo just laughed. The next morning, Cheekoo woke up to a foul smell and the sound of buzzing flies. The cloud of trash was hanging over her head. Ammas words had come true! And then, Cheekoo was unable to laugh. Cheekoo tried to run away. But the trash cloud followed her everywhere. Cheekoo took a broom to sweep the cloud down. But the trash could not be swept away. Cheekoo tried EVERYTHING . She screamed and asked the cloud to leave her alone. She even tried throwing the cloud into the dustbin. But the cloud of trash just wouldnt go. So Cheekoo became very unhappy. Then something happened! Cheekoo saw Bala throwing a banana peel on the road. Cheekoo was annoyed. Could he not see the cloud over her head? ""Oye silly boy!"" she yelled. ""Dont throw the peel on the road. Someone will slip!"" Bala, scared of the trash cloud, threw the peel in the dustbin. The next day, the trash cloud had become smaller! ""How did that happen?"" Cheekoo wondered. Then, Cheekoo saw Reema Aunty throwing away plastic bags. ""Aunty!"" Cheekoo said. ""Please pick up these bags and reuse them."" Reema Aunty picked up the bags and left. The next day when Cheekoo woke up, the cloud was much smaller. Cheekoo smiled. She knew what she had to do. When someone threw away a biscuit packet or pencil shavings, Cheekoo stopped them. She picked up every twisted plastic bottle and put it in the dustbin. The village became cleaner and cleaner. And Cheekoos cloud became smaller and smaller. Until one day, it was gone. COMPLETELY gone. Cheekoo was now perhaps the happiest girl in the world. Cheekoo never littered again. Secretly, she liked living in a clean village. But she was also scared that the trash cloud would come back, some day. Who knew! Lets Talk About Trash Ever wondered what happens to trash once you throw it away? No, it doesnt become a cloud on your head. The trash ends up in a big garbage bin near your home. When you litter, the trash collects by the side of the road. Some of it goes into the drains that carry waste water from your house. This clogs the drains and attracts flies which spread nasty diseases! UGH! Nobody likes living in a dirty environment. Ask Cheekoo. Heres how NOT to make a cloud of trash - We can start by not littering our surroundings. - Always, always throw waste into a dustbin look around for the nearest one. - After you eat a banana, dont throw it on the road. Put the peel in a small bag until you find a dustbin. - There are many things that you may think are useless, like the paper bag into which you put the peel. But not everything is waste. So dont throw the bag with the peel! Take it home and reuse it. - Cover dustbins so that flies cant get inside.'}"

Be careful!"" says Amma. He crawls like a centipede and slithers like a snake. ""Look out for thorns!"" says Amma. He swings like a spider and leaps like a langur. ""Wheeeee!"" ""Use the strong branches, my little monkey,"" says Amma. He paddles like a duck and swims like a frog. ""Stay in the shallows, okay?"" says Amma. He climbs like a lizard and jumps like a goat. ""Dont slip!"" says Amma. Satya flaps his arms like wings and tries to fly away. He imagines himself soaring and gliding like a vulture. Late in the evening, when the sun sets and crickets begin to hum, its time to go home. Tired Satya climbs on to his mother\'s back. They return through the up-and-down paths, fields, forests and streams. At home, Appa, Akka and Thaatha take one look at bruised and muddy Satya, and burst into laughter. Thaatha bathes him. Appa cooks him dinner. Akka tells him his favourite story as he falls asleep. In his dreams, Satya runs and jumps and spins and rolls... ... and flies away! How do they move? Oh, the way Satya moves! Did you know that animals, birds and insects also move in many different ways and for different reasons? Like us, they move mainly to find delicious food, a cozy home and a warm family. Some of them also move to escape from being caught and eaten by other animals. Find out how some of these creatures move! Dolphins are famous for how they leap out of water. Can you leap ? Cheetahs are the fastest land animals. They can run really fast and sprint too, especially when they hunt. Can you sprint ? Crabs can walk sideways. Can you walk sideways ? Grasshoppers can jump really high, especially when they want to escape from being eaten. Can you jump really high ? Snails crawl. Slowly. Very, very slowly. Can you crawl slowly ?'}"

They had been waiting and waiting for their first run, and today was the day! Last night, they had been brought home from the shop for Shazia. They were bright red, and each had two little ghungroos at the centre. Shazia\'s sister had put them there last night. Shazia loved the sound of ghunghroos even though she hated dancing or at least dancing the way the teacher told her to. The new bicycle was her big surprise as she was turning six today. It had two little trainer wheels. And the little wheels could not wait to be on the road. They hadnt even seen a road yet! But they had heard plenty about it. The older bikes in the shop had gone on and on about the traffic, the dust, the noise, the gravel, the pain, the honking, the pits, and how hard and tiring and grown up it was to be on the road. The tiny wheelies werent put off by any of this. For them, the road was full of adventure Shazia would race in and out of the lanes, and they would roll and roll, and make merry tinkling sounds with each roll, and never let her fall. So while they waited and giggled, they also sang, "" We are the wheelies, the wheely-wheely wheelies The only-wonly wheelies, of the whole wide world."" They had been hushed and they had been shushed, but they did not stop. So it was no surprise that after the fifty-ninth time, everyone around them, including the bigger wheels of the bike, turned to them and said in one voice, ""Enough!"" ""Meeep,"" they said in surprise and looked about. ""All of us have wheels working somewhere,"" the fan in the room said, ""so do stop with this only-wonly nonsense."" ""And with that awful tune!"" said the bell, who was feeling a bit unhappy about not being the only sound-making thing on the cycle. ""You dont have wheels,"" the little ones said to the fan, ""and neither do you,"" to the bell. ""That is what you think!"" said the fan. ""My motor has wheels and my blades move because of electricity which is produced with the help of wheels, BIG-BIG wheels, and lots of them."" ""And I go tring tring because of little wheels inside me that produce the sound,"" said the bell. ""We were made with machines that cannot work without wheels,"" said the tubelight from the wall. ""And I would not be there to eat if the wheels of the millstone did not grind the wheat,"" said the rotis from the dabba on the table. ""Hey, who would get watered without the water wheels then?"" asked the lime pickle. ""None of us!"" the mango chutney replied. And the big wheels of the cycle said, ""This cycle only would not have been made."" ""And I would just be a fancy needle without wheels,"" the sewing machine said from its corner. The little wheels went quiet. A few minutes later, they started another song. ""We are the wheelies, the wheely-wheely wheelies The wonder-ful wheelies, that run the whole wide world."" Slowly, everyone joined in the singing. Little sleepy Shazia thought she heard some singing. She jumped out of bed and woke everyone else up too. It was her birthday after all, so she got to do what she wanted. And soon the little wheelies, the big wheels, the whole cycle, Shazia on the cycle and her sister running behind her, all came out to the lane and started running on the gravel. The wheels were going on to the road! Wheels are everywhere! When you look around, youll see that wheels are all around us. Make a list of things in which wheels are used at home, in your school, on the streets. Above are a few just to get you started. Ask your parents and teachers to add to your list.'}"

Lets go to the park,"" Laila Miss says. All the students hold hands, chattering away. Kavya stands by herself. As they start walking, Laila Miss asks, ""Does anyone know what a caterpillar becomes when it grows up?"" Kavyas stomach flips. She knows the answer! Should she say something? Kavya and her family have just moved to Bengaluru from her village. They live at the construction site where her parents work. Its hard living in a half-finished house. The air smells of smoke, and the honking traffic makes it hard to sleep. The towering buildings, zooming cars, and busy people make her feel very, very small. Kavya has been coming to school for a week. She still hasnt spoken to anyone. What if they make fun of her accent? Or tease her because shes never been to school before? Kavya takes a deep breath and raises her hand. In a noisy city like Bengaluru, she cant be quiet forever. ""When caterpillars grow up, they become butterflies,"" Kavya says. ""Thats right!"" Laila Miss says. ""Caterpillars are only caterpillars for a few weeks,"" Kavya says. ""They spend that whole time eating leaves."" ""They must get very big,"" says Mary, her classmate. ""They do!"" ""After they eat and eat and eat, caterpillars weave cocoons on the sides of plants. They go inside, where they grow and change,"" says Kavya. ""Thats correct,"" Laila Miss says. ""They stay in the cocoons for about two weeks. When they come out, they are butterflies."" ""Look, were at the park!"" Mary says. Kavya gasps. The park is covered in butterflies! Blue butterflies the colour of rivers. Yellow butterflies the colour of sunlight. Orange butterflies the colour of ripe chikoos. Black-and-white butterflies the colours of starry skies. These are all the colours Kavya misses from her village. She feels her heart flutter. ""Every year, butterflies travel thousands of kilometres to come to this park. They are here for more food, better weather, and a safe place to lay eggs,"" Laila Miss says. ""This journey is called migration."" ""Dont they get tired, flapping their wings for so long?"" a classmate asks. ""If there is a strong wind, they dont have to flap their wings,"" Kavya says. ""They spread their wings and glide."" ""That must be bumpy,"" Mary whispers to Kavya. Kavya thinks about the bus ride to Bengaluru squeezed in between all the luggage. Bumping and tumbling for hours and hours and hours. Is that how a butterfly feels on the wind? ""When butterflies migrate, they follow rivers. To stay healthy, they stop along the riverbank to soak up minerals with their feet. Its called mud-puddling,"" Laila Miss says. ""Mud-puddling?"" Mary says. ""That sounds like fun."" Mary and Kavya smile at each other. ""It is,"" Kavya says. ""But now puddles are hard to find."" In Kavyas village, men in trucks take sand away from the river. The weather gets hotter and hotter. There is less and less rain. Last year, the river went dry. The butterflies didnt have enough water to mud-puddle. Kavyas family didnt have enough water to farm. Thats why they moved to Bengaluru. ""You know a lot about butterflies, Kavya,"" says Laila Miss. ""Thats because they are my favourite insects,"" says Kavya. ""Why do you love butterflies so much, Kavya?"" asks Mary. How can Kavya choose just one thing? She loves how their bodies are sometimes spotted and sometimes striped. How they drink nectar with their long noses. How they spread pollen, which makes more flowers grow. ""They fly far, but wherever they land, they make new friends,"" Kavya says, squeezing Marys hand. ""Theyre very small, but theyre also very brave."" ""Just like you,"" Laila Miss says. Kavya smiles a smile as wide as a butterflys wings. Make a Butterfly Rest Station Butterflies in India migrate twice a year. Their journey is getting harder and harder because our forests and rivers are disappearing. Butterflies dont have enough places to rest. Many get tired along the way. One way to help butterflies is to make safe spaces for them to stop and have a good meal. Heres how to make a butterfly rest station: Find a flat vessel with high edges, like a thali or a plate. Butterflies love bright colours. Paint the vessel red, yellow, or orange. Fill the vessel with butterfly food. Its easy to make! Mix four cups of water with one cup of sugar. Add pieces of over-ripe fruit. Butterflies love bananas, guavas, mangoes, papayas, and oranges. Keep the vessel out on your veranda, windowsill, or anywhere outside. Clean and refill the vessel every two to three days. To attract even more butterflies, plant flowers that butterflies love. You can plant verbena, geraniums, dahlias, or sunflowers. You dont need a lot of space you can plant them in pots on the ground, or keep them on windowsills.'}"

Raji jumped up, leapt over the compound wall and started running down the road. ""Give that back, you useless, food-stealing, peanut-brained crow!"" Raji shouted. The crow was flying slowly. Its body was getting bigger and heavier. Worse, its wings were getting smaller. ""I\'ll get you soon!"" Raji said. Salim came cycling down the road. The tired crow dropped from the sky and fell on Salim and his cycle: CRASH! Raji ran up to them. Salim was lying on the ground with his cycle. There was a weird creature on his head, flapping wildly. It was large and strong. And it had teeth. It bit Salim, hard. CHOMP! ""Aaaarghh!"" screamed Salim. ""Your crow is eating me!"" ""Thats not my crow,"" Raji said. ""Actually, its not a crow at all."" They looked at the not-crow. ""Youre right. Thats a dinosaur!"" yelled Salim. The crow-dinosaur flapped and ran towards the bazaar. ""What if it bites more people?"" asked Raji. ""We should stop it,"" Salim replied. The crow-dinosaur stomped through the bazaar, yelling KAA KRAAAAA and knocking everyone over. Only Prof. Aunty watched it with wonder: ""Is that? Am I losing my mind? Could it be a real live theropod?"" Raji and Salim helped Prof. Aunty up. ""Prof. Aunty, have you seen ?"" asked Raji and Salim. She said, ""A bird-dinosaur? Yes, I have.

Raji and Salim and Prof. Aunty followed. Raji ran extra fast and threw herself at it. ""Got you!"" Raji held the crow-dinosaur close. Salim sat down and said, ""Its turning into a T-Rex!"" ""They are... aaah the same hamaa family,"" panted Prof. Aunty. ""Birds and dinosaurs, I mean. Its evolving backwards."" A lizard ran by and the dinosaur snapped at it. ""Yuck, gross, cannibal!"" shouted Raji. ""Its like if I ate my cousins!"" said Salim. ""No, it isnt,"" Prof. Aunty said. ""Birds are descended from dinosaurs. So theyre fairly close to crocodiles. But lizards are an entirely different kind of reptile."" The crow-dinosaur curled up on the ground and made an unhappy noise: Kraa-kroomp . ""I think its sad it can no longer fly,"" said Salim. Raji patted its snout kindly. They went to Prof. Auntys house. On the table was a plate of bajjis. ""Mmm,"" Raji said. ""Kraaa!"" said the dinosaur. It stretched as tall as Prof. Aunty, snatched the entire plate, crunched the bajjis and the steel. Then it made a loud BURP, and stuck all its teeth out in a huge, happy grin: Kaaaa! Raji and Salim exchanged a grin and said together, ""Kaakasaurus Rex!"" Birds are descended from a family of dinosaurs called theropods. They are often called ""living dinosaurs."" Apart from a few differences, birds and dinosaurs are really very similar: Birds Shorter tail-bones Long, smooth, feathers for flying, scales on feet and sometimes necks Beaks, no teeth Large wings Light, hollow bones Dinosaurs Long tails Scales, and short, fuzzy feathers Snouts, lots of teeth Small wings, incapable of flight Heavier bones Make a birdosaur!

So when you gotta go, you gotta go! Some people can do this business inside their houses, some have to go outside. Some pour water after its done, others need not. Its different in different parts of the world, just as it was different at different times in history. Toilets of the past A very long time ago, more than 3,000 years ago, the people of Indus Valley had beautiful houses with toilets built inside them. People could finish their business in privacy and pour a bucket of water which would flush the waste down a drain. This way, they managed to keep their houses and streets clean. The Indus Valley, situated in present day Pakistan and India, is one of the three oldest civilizations that we know of, the other two being Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. From what we can see of the ruins today, the people of Indus Valley had great building skills, were good at making metal and ceramic products, and planned their city-wide drainage systems very elaborately. Around the same time, similar toilet arrangements were present in other parts of the world. Homes in Egypt and Babylonia had toilets built in, and the ruins in Skara Brae in Scotland and the Minoan Crete in the Mediterranean show plenty of pipes leading out of what definitely seems like a toilet inside a house. A little later, about 2,000 years ago in Rome, people used public toilets. A long slab of stone had keyhole-shaped cuts at intervals. People would sit on these openings and do their toilet business while having a friendly chat with the person next to them. I told you it was a public toilet! How did they clean themselves, do you wonder? After I tell you, you might wish you had never wondered. They took a long stick that had a sponge attached to one end and dipped the sponge into water, and then used it to wipe their backsides. After they felt clean, they simply handed the stick over to their neighbour, who dipped it in water and used it again. Let me give you a friendly tip here if you ever find yourself in this place, make sure you pick the very first seat! Not everyone had to poop in public in Rome. If you were super-rich, you would have a chamber pot at home into which you would do your business. Once done, you would simply empty the contents onto the street outside. And if someone happened to walk by at the time, well, too bad for them! About 500 years ago, Queen Elizabeth of England had a toilet constructed inside her house. It had a pipe leading out into a sewage pit outside. But she never used it much because the stench from the sewer filled the toilet and she could not even breathe. So back to the chamber pot she went. Toilets of the present Toilets these days dont stink. How did they achieve that? In 1775, the English inventor Alexander Cumming figured out a way. Instead of using a straight pipe to connect the toilet to the sewage line, he made it S-shaped. This made sure that while poop and pee and water can go down the drain, no smell can come back up. Have you noticed that a little water always stays in the toilet even after flushing? This is what creates the ""seal"" and prevents the foul smell from entering the room through the drain. Just like olden times, different parts of the world today have different kinds of toilets. Some places dont have toilets at all. Some toilets are made for sitting, some are made for squatting. Some have a bucket with water for flushing, others have a tank filled with water and a handle that releases the water. Some toilets have paper to wipe the backside, some have a tap or a bucket of water to wash up. There are some toilets that dont use water at all. Like the ones on a plane. With all the turbulence, you certainly dont want any water in the toilet bowl! The waste is removed by a powerful vacuum and stored in a tank below. After the plane lands, the waste is disposed of. There are also waterless toilets on the ground. They were designed and built for places without easy access to water, such as remote villages in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. They have been working well, so wouldnt it be a good idea to have such toilets everywhere? Because the less water we use, and the less sewage we create, the better for the planet, right? Toilets of the future How do you make a waterless toilet? The first step is to make sure that you dont let the urine and the faeces mix. No its not as gross as it sounds it just needs the pot to be designed in a clever way. Like having a sloping bamboo mat act as a sieve that will allow the waste water to pass through, but can hold the poop and send it to a different pit. Since urine by itself is not harmful (its only the bacteria that collect on open urine that cause the smell and the hazard), it can be safely let into the ground or put to use. Heres how: Hydrogen can be separated from the urine and used to fuel a generator. Urine also has nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium that are great ingredients for fertilizers. Now that urine is taken care of, what do we do with the solid waste? Well, if it is properly mixed with ash and grass, and allowed to rest in a pit, millions of bacteria will break it down into perfectly useful compost for agriculture. These toilets will help us build a world where there is no ""waste."" Instead it is turned into something of use. If all houses in a city have such toilets, no sewage comes out of them, no expensive sewage treatment plants are necessary and no sewage will flow through the drains into lakes and rivers! What a great future for everyone! On pg 18 is a board game. Youll need a few friends to play with and a die. Below are instructions on what to do if you land here: At 3 Queens chamber pot: Illegal use of Queens chamber pot. Punishment: Banished into her toilet for 2 turns. At 6 Roman toilet first seat: Good for you! First use of sponge! Move ahead 7 spaces. At 9 Stuck in the toilet queue! Move only if you roll a 2 or a 4. At 12 Roman toilet last seat: Yuck. Dont want to use that sponge? Okay, we\'ll let you kill the time. Lose a turn. At 15 Mohenjo-daro: Congratulations! You have entered one of the best toilets of all time! So you get to roll the die again. If you roll 2,4,6 move that many spaces forward. If you roll 1,3,5 you can pick any pawn on the board (other than yours) and move it that many spaces back. At 19 Oops. Left the toilet dirty. Move back 3 spaces. At 21 Waterless toilet: Congratulations! You just used a waterless toilet! Take the short-cut! At 23 Flying waste! Oh dear! You got hit by flying waste! Move only if you roll a 1 or 6.'}"

But they cant see whats on top of their heads! They are one of the fastest runners on the planet. They are the colour of the sand, and you can barely see them as they dart across the beach. Fiddler Crabs: Male Fiddler Crabs have one large claw, and they use it to show how big and powerful they are. Because of the way they swing this claw, they are also called Dhobi Crabs. It looks as if they are washing clothes by swinging an arm. Moon Crabs: Moon Crabs have flat, paddle-like legs that help them in swimming and digging. They feed on other crabs and smaller fish. When threatened, they draw their legs up under their hard shell and pretend to be dead. Spot the Crab! Hidden around Keyas beach are many crabs.

The path was called orbit. 8 stable planets going around the sun Four rocky inner PLANETS -- Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars -- and four gassy outer PLANETS -- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune -- make up the eight major PLANETS of our solar system. Pluto used to be the ninth planet but in 2006, International Astronomical Union (IAU) decided that Pluto was a dwarf planet. 7 icy comets passing through COMETS are large chunks of ice, rock and gas. They orbit the Sun, but are usually far from Earth. As they pass, they leave a trail that looks like a tail. Some famous comets are Hale-Bopp, Halley, Hyakutake and Shoemaker-Levy. 6 curious people looking through telescopes T ELESCOPES help us see objects that are far, far away like the comets, stars, planets, and moons. 5 small dwarf planets hanging around DWARF PLANETS are like planets but they are much smaller and they do not yet have a clear path around the Sun. This means that objects like asteroids and comets litter their path.

The sun was still asleep. Chinni yawned as she rode on Abba\'s cycle. She helped him in his bakery before going to school. Creak... went the old bakery shutter as Abba pulled it up. ""I\'m so sleepy,"" said Chinni. Abba smiled. ""Today is a special day."" ""Oh yes, Bimla\'s birthday!"" said Chinni. She was jumping up and down. Bimla was Chinni\'s best friend. ""Would you like to bake her a cake?"" asked Abba. ""Yes, yes, yes!"" said Chinni happily. Abba and Chinni brought the things they needed from the storeroom. Flour Butter Sugar Baking powder Eggs Milk ""How about some chocolate?"" asked Chinni. ""Bimla loves chocolate."" It was Chinni\'s favourite too. ""Good idea,"" said Abba. He got some cocoa powder and put it in a bowl. ""This doesn\'t look like chocolate,"" said Chinni, sniffing the bowl. That made her sneeze. ""When we mix cocoa powder, butter and sugar, it becomes chocolate,"" said Abba. ""Ooh, magic!"" Chinni\'s eyes became round. ""No, chemistry!"" said Abba with a smile. ""What is keh-miss-tree, Abba?"" asked Chinni. ""When different things come together and change into new things, it is chemistry."" ""Is baking a cake keh-miss-tree too?"" ""Yes, it is!"" Abba mixed the butter and sugar till they were creamy. Then he showed Chinni how to break the eggs. Oops, one fell to the floor. ""Oh no!"" said Chinni. ""It\'s okay,"" said Abba. ""We can clean it up."" Chinni beat the eggs with a whisk. ""My arms are aching,"" she complained. ""You are doing a great job. Beating the eggs makes the cake light and spongy,"" said Abba. He mixed the flour, baking powder and cocoa powder together with a pinch of... ""Salt?"" Chinni was surprised. ""Bimla won\'t like a salty cake."" ""A little salt makes the cake taste sweeter,"" said Abba. ""It also helps to hold up the cake."" ""Is that chemistry too?"" asked Chinni. ""That\'s right!"" said Abba. Chinni looked at the dough. ""This is all wet and mushy,"" she said. ""It doesn\'t look like cake at all."" Abba turned on the oven. ""That\'s why we heat it,"" he said. ""Heat changes the egg and helps the cake become firm. When water is mixed with baking powder, gases are formed, giving rise to bubbles. This makes the cake rise and become light. And butter and milk keep it soft."" ""What about the chocolate?"" This was very important to Chinni! ""The cocoa powder will mix with the sugar and the butter, and become chocolate in the cake,"" said Abba. Soon a delicious aroma filled the bakery. Chinni and Abba wore thick gloves. Then, they took the hot cake out of the oven carefully. Abba would have to wait for the cake to cool. Then, he would add some icing and decorate the cake. After school, Bimla and Chinni walked to the bakery. Abba was waiting at the door. ""Surprise!"" said father and daughter in chorus and led Bimla in. ""Happy Birthday, Bimla!"" Chinni stuffed a piece of cake into her friend\'s mouth. ""Mmmm ... oh how is this cake so spongy?"" We know how. Don\'t you? Chemistry - the science of change Chemistry (pronounced keh-miss-tree): The study of matter and how it changes. Matter : Just another word for \'things\'. Everything in this world is made of matter. And matter is made of little bits called molecules. And molecules are made of even tinier bits called atoms. Chemical reaction : When the atoms of one molecule combine with other atoms, new molecules are formed. This is called a chemical reaction. Chemistry all around us : Chemistry is everywhere. It is in the air we breathe, the soap we use for bathing, and the medicines we take when we fall sick. And, of course, in the food we eat. Chemical reactions in baking 1 . Water and wheat flour : Wheat has a protein called gluten. When water is mixed with wheat flour, the gluten becomes sticky, like glue. This makes the dough elastic and helps the cake to rise. It gives the cake body when n is heated in the oven. 2 . Baking powder : When baking powder is mixed with water, carbon dioxide gas is released. This forms bubbles and helps the cake rise and become spongy. 3. Eggs : When eggs cook in the heat of the oven, they make the cake firm while still keeping it moist. Beaten eggs also trap air bubbles, making the cake light. 4. Chocolate : Cocoa powder is bitter. But when we mix it with the right amount of butter and sugar, and heat the mixture, it becomes yummy chocolate.'}"

Amma opened the door. Raghu Mama! Amish and Soni cried, giving him a big hug. Raghu Mama was their mothers only brother. He always told the best stories and brought them the most interesting presents. But there was one problem with Raghu Mama. Raghu Mama was so lazy that he could sit in his chair, for hours and hours and hours, reading or watching TV. Or just sleeping. He would not do any work around the house or even go to the market to buy groceries. Amma was fed up of his laziness. So, Raghu, said Amma. Planning to spend the holiday in your favourite chair as usual? Oh no! said Raghu Mama. This time Im going to explore underwater caves, climb tall mountains, and chase tigers in the jungle. Where, where? exclaimed Amish and Soni. We want to come too! Hah! said Amma. What a joke! Raghu Mama smiled mysteriously. The next day, when Raghu Mama was in his room, Amish and Soni overheard him talking to someone. Wow! he was saying. Then, Thats AMAZING! A little later, OH NO! The children burst into his room. What happened, Raghu Mama? Raghu Mama was in his favourite chair, wearing a pair of big black goggles. There was no one else around! Soni and Amish exchanged a curious look. Is everything okay, Mama? Amish asked, staring at the dark goggles that hid almost all of Mamas face. Raghu laughed and took off the goggles. Here, try this, he said to Soni. What is it? asked Soni. The goggles were so heavy that she had to hold them with both hands. Raghu Mama carefully put the goggles on Sonis face. The goggles were dark and she couldnt see anything at first. Then he pressed a button. Suddenly Soni was in the ocean! There were colourful fish all around. She turned her face to the left and saw a big turtle swimming beside her. It was so close that she thought she could reach out and touch it. Then she turned her face to the other side . . . Eek! she cried as a huge shark swam very close to her. Let me see, let me see! said Amish, trying to take the goggles off a stunned Soni. It will be your turn next, Amish, said Raghu Mama. I have just the adventure for you. Amish put on the goggles and Mama pressed another button. Ooh, I can see herds of chital! And langurs! Amish was in a thick forest full of trees. He could hear different bird sounds. When he looked up, he could see a flock of geese flying in a V-shaped formation across the sky. It feels so real, said Soni. When I wore the goggles it was as if I were swimming underwater! Yes, said Raghu Mama. I guess that is why it is called Virtual Reality. Soni was confused. But doesnt virtual mean not real? she asked. So how can you have reality that is not real? That is a really smart question, said Raghu Mama. We call it Virtual Reality, or VR, because it makes you feel that what you are watching is real. So it is almost real. Help! cried Amish. A tiger is about to eat me up! Raghu Mama laughed. Dont worry, you are quite safe! he told Amish. It is like watching a movie, but better, said Soni, excited. Exactly, said Mama. When we watch a movie in a cinema theatre, the screen is only in front of us. When we wear the VR goggles, it feels like the movie is all around us. So, do you want to spend your summer vacation exploring Virtual Reality like me? asked Raghu Mama. Amish took off the goggles and thought for a bit. I think I prefer the REAL reality, he said. But why? asked Raghu Mama, surprised. I saw a juicy mango in the jungle, said Amish. And now I want to eat one. I cant do that in Virtual Reality. I want one too! said Soni. Both of them ran to the kitchen. Wait for me! said Raghu Mama, right behind them, finally off his favourite chair. Virtual Reality Bytes 1. The term Virtual Reality was first used in 1983 in a science fiction story called The Judas Mandala by Damien Broderick. 2. Virtual Reality (VR) is made by very powerful computers that can use the small screens inside goggles to create a three-dimensional (3D) world that looks and feels very much like a real world. 3. VR goggles have sensors in them that detect how your eyes are moving. For example, if you look up, the picture in the goggles changes to what you would see if you were looking up in real life. So if you were in a jungle, like Amish, and looking up, the screen would show you a sky instead of the forest. 4. Virtual Reality is not just used for playing games and exploring new worlds. It can also be used to train people to do difficult jobs. Firefighters can use VR to practise rescuing people from burning buildings, and astronauts can practise living in space and exploring new worlds. Imagine being able to understand what walking on Mars would be like before even setting foot inside a spaceship! 5. Are VR goggles safe for children to use? Most scientists believe that it has the same effect as watching a small screen like a mobile phone, so we need to be careful about how often and how long we use it.'}"

We shall see so many spiders, Our heads will spin, spin, spin! Is that an ant or a spider? asks Kaveri. It looks like an ant, but it has eight legs. Uff, ants are insects. All insects have six legs, not eight. But you are right, this does look like an ant! says Shivi. Full marks, says Shama. It is an ant-mimic spider. Kaveri and Shivi love being with Shama. She is studying to be a wildlife biologist, and is full of fun facts and stories about different animals and plants. Just then, Kaveri spots a sac spider. It's neatly rolled up inside a leaf. How did you find it? asks Shivi. Ah! When you get to know the different signs that spiders make, you start finding them everywhere, Shama says, with a wink. We are off to see spiders, Some fat, some thin, some hairy. They have eight legs and eight eyes, But dont worry! They are not scary! Ummm, that looks like a crab, says Shivi, squinting at a yellow flower. Ha! Shama says. Its the crab spider. And look, it has caught a poor bee that was visiting the flower for nectar. Ah, no wonder the bee didnt see the spider. Its almost the same colour as the flower, says Kaveri. Look, look, yells Shivi, pointing towards the leaves on the damp ground. A female wolf spider is carrying her egg sac. And there is another one! Ooh! There are hundreds of tiny baby spiders on her back! Shama whispers in awe. We are off to see spiders, Oh where, oh where, oh where? On grass, on leaves, on flowers, Here, there and everywhere! Shivi is leaning on a tree trunk when suddenly he jumps in fright. Something scuttled by at lightning speed. There you are! Shama says, moving closer. See how well the two-tailed spider blends with the tree bark? Heres a spider that looks like it has only four legs, Kaveri says excitedly, pointing towards a bush. The spider has spun a wheel-shaped web between two plants. What a beautiful zigzag pattern! This has to be the cross spider, Shama exclaims. We are off to see spiders, So far we've had quite a catch! Hey! Someones spinning lovely webs, On this grassy patch. Kaveri, Shivi and Shama stumble upon a sheet-and-tunnel web spider. So many webs, Kaveri exclaims. They look like delicate sheets. This juicy grasshopper stuck in the web will become spider food soon. Slurp! says Shivi. Right! Its time to go home now, says Shama, looking at her watch. I have to study for my class tomorrow. Kaveri and Shivis faces fall. Oh don't worry, theres plenty to see at home as well, says Shama. Back home, Shama spies the common house spider. Oh! Theres the daddy-long-legs spider. They are funny, says Kaveri. They dangle upside down and have long, long legs. Back home, Shama spies the common house spider. Oh! Theres the daddy-long-legs spider. They are funny, says Kaveri. They dangle upside down and have long, long legs. We saw so many wondrous spiders, On grass, trees and flower heads. Lets crawl and look for more of them. Will we find some under our beds? Spider Guide Meet the spiders that Kaveri, Shivi and Shama see on their walk. Two-tailed spiders These spiders get their name because of their long spinning organs that look like a tail. With a flat body, these spiders blend in very well on tree trunks and walls. Ant-mimic spiders They behave just like ants, and look like them too! These spiders in disguise trick animals and birds that like to eat spiders. Crab spiders With a much longer and stronger pair of front legs, these spiders often extend their legs while waiting to catch their food. This pose makes them look very much like a crab! Wolf spiders You will often find wolf spiders scuttling on the ground, especially where there are leaves and shrubs. A female wolf spider carries egg sacs attached to her spinning organs. When the sac opens, hundreds of baby spiders climb onto her back and stay there for several days. Sac spiders These spiders rest inside silken sacs that they make within rolled leaves and blades of grass. They come out of their silken retreats when they have to hunt for food. Sheet-and-tunnel web spiders These spiders make beautiful and delicate sheet-like webs. A tunnel at the end of the sheet web is the perfect hiding place for them. They dart out when an insect gets caught in the web. Daddy-long-legs spiders These common house spiders are found on the ceiling and in the corners of houses and sheds. Their cobwebs may look untidy, but they catch a lot of flying insect pests. Cross spiders When cross spiders are on their wheel-shaped webs, they look like a large X! They are also called signature spiders because of the zigzag pattern they make on their webs.""}"

Which is heavy and which is light? What a silly question, you say. The stone is heavy and the feather is light, of course! Here is an elephant and here is the same stone. Which is heavy and which is light? What an absurd question, you say. The elephant is heavy and the stone is light, of course! Wait, didnt you just say that the stone was heavy? Yes, that was because it was heavier than the feather! But it is MUCH lighter than an elephant. So maybe it is best not to say, This is heavy, or This is light. Maybe it is better to ask: Is this heavi ER than something else? Is this light ER than something else? But what about the question - How heavy is this stone? Can we find the answer without talking about elephants or feathers? Yes, we can! We can compare the weight of the stone to something called a kilogram. A kilogram is used to find out how heavy or light a thing is. A good question to ask then is - How much heavier than a kilogram is the stone? Or How much lighter than a kilogram is our stone? A kilogram is the same thing as kilo or kg. From now on, lets say kg when we mean kilogram its shorter. But how heavy is a kg? Let\'s see. You tell the vegetable vendor at the market, Please give me 1 kg of onions."" The vendor puts a 1-kg weight on one side of the scale and piles onions on the other side until the two sides are level. You count the onions on the scale. There are 13 onions. That tells you that 1 kg is as heavy as 13 onions. But this is not entirely reliable. When the onions are small, 1 kg may be as heavy as 16 onions. When they are big, 1 kg may be only as heavy as 10 onions. We need to find something that weighs EXACTLY 1 kg. I know! A 1-litre bottle of water weighs exactly 1 kg. Now that we know this, lets get back to our elephant. How heavy is an elephant in kgs? Around 4,000 kg! So if you could get an elephant to sit on one side of a pair of scales, you would need a whopping 4,000 1-litre water bottles to balance its weight. 4,000 kg is also the weight of 10 cows, or 200 medium-sized dogs. Now that we have talked about some Very Heavy things, let us ask a bolder question - How heavy is the Earth? The Earth, including all the creatures in it, weighs ... ... 5,974,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kgs! Or as much as 5,974,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 1-litre water bottles! That is very, VERY heavy! Even if we used all the water on earth, there would not be enough to fill them all. Uff. This conversation is getting too heavy. Let us bring the feather back. How light is a feather? It is roughly 2,00,000 times lighter than a kg. If you put a 1-litre water bottle on one side of a scale, you would have to put about 2,00,000 feathers on the other side to make the two sides balance. A raindrop is about 30,000 times lighter than a kg. Roughly 30,000 raindrops will weigh as much as a 1-litre bottle of water. A grain of salt is about 2,00,00,000 (two crore) times lighter than a kg. That is very, VERY light! Phew! You must be feeling quite light-headed now. And your brain must be buzzing with questions. Questions like: How do we weigh a grain of sand? How on earth did people weigh the Earth? Who decided the weight of 1 kg? Bet you cant wait to find the answers when you grow up! Guesstimate It Perfect for both classroom and home, this activity will help children get a feel for weight estimation. You will need: - A pair of scales with two pans and weights - A 1-litre bottle filled with water - Objects of different weights found in school or at home - a small bag of vegetables, a book, a duster, a packet of rice, and so on. What to do: 1. Pass the bottle of water around the class asking each child to feel its weight. This gives them a sense of how heavy a kg is. 2. Pass the other objects around one by one, asking each child if the object feels heavier or lighter than 1 kg. Also ask each to guess the actual weight of each object and write it on the board. 3. Weigh each object on the scales, first against the 1-litre bottle (to answer the question \'Is it heavier or lighter than 1 kg?\') and then against the actual weights, to see how good each child\'s guesstimate was. If it is difficult to find a pair of scales, invite the local vegetable vendor to your classroom (with his scales!). In Step 2 above, pass bags of vegetables (of different weights) around. Think About It 1. On page 8, you found out that a 1-litre bottle of water weighs exactly 1 kg. How many water bottles would add up to YOUR weight? 2. You now know that an average-sized Indian elephant weighs about 4,000 kgs. If we told you that a train loaded with passengers weighs the same as 250 elephants, can you find out how many kgs it weighs? 3. Which is heavier 1 kg of iron or 1 kg of cotton wool? Answers: 2. 10,00,000 (ten lakh) kgs (250 x 4000 10,00,000) 3. They are both EQUALLY heavy because both weigh the same 1 kg! But 1 kg of cotton wool would take up a LOT more space than 1 kg of iron.'}"

They were expensive and useless! Do you know what Anna really wished for? Books, books and more books! We have books at home! said her brother. But Anna had already read those. There are more in the library, pointed out her grandfather. But Anna had read those too! She marched into her room. Hmmph! L ater that day, there was a knock on Annas door. But there was nobody outside! Instead, there lay a big box at her doorstep. This better not be more jewellery! she said loudly. It wasnt. It was a brand new Encyclopaedia set! So many books. Hurray! Anna ran around her house, hugging everyone. Many years, and many, many, many books later, Anna found a job in the laboratory of a famous scientist. What should I do here? asked Anna. The scientist pointed to a box. What do you think she found inside? Diamonds? Aiyyyye! said Anna. But this time, the diamonds were not to be worn. They were for experiments. The scientist wanted Anna to find out what makes diamonds shine. So she read books about diamonds. Books, books and more books! Being a scientist was the best! Anna could study anything she wanted. She did like things that shine. And what shines brighter than diamonds? The sun! So Anna read books about the sun, sunlight and weather. Books, books and more books! Anna did hundreds of experiments. She built many gadgets to measure the weather of a place. How sunny is it in Bombay? Anna built a gadget to measure that. How windy is it in Madras? Anna built a gadget for that too. Her favourite gadget took many months to build. It was a special balloon called ozonesonde. It had a small machine fixed to it. The machine measured a gas found in the air called ozone. Ozonesondes fly really high. Look, there goes Annas ozonesonde! Guess how many gadgets Anna Mani built in all? Nearly one hundred weather gadgets! She even had her own factory to make these gadgets. It was as if she could build anything! Anna Mani became one of the wisest weather scientists in India. Even as she grew older and more well-known, her best friends remained the same. Books, books and more books! Life Times of Anna: A Timeline 23 August, 1918 - Anna Mani is born in Peermedu in Kerala. 1940 - She gets a scholarship to work at CV Ramans laboratory in Bangalore. 1945 - She leaves for England to study meteorology. 1948 - She returns and joins the Indian Meteorological Department in Pune. 1962 - She starts work on the ozonesonde project. 1976 - She retires as Deputy Director General of the Indian Meteorological department. In the 1980s (exact year unknown) - She starts her own company to manufacture her gadgets. 16 August, 2001 - Anna Mani passes away in Kerala. Wonderful Weather Words Meteorologist (say it like this: meet-your-all-o-jist) : A meteorologist is a scientist who studies the weather and climate of a region. Anna Mani was one of the best meteorologists there ever was. Ozonesonde (say it like this: oh-zone-sond) : Ozonesondes are balloons that fly high up into the sky. The balloons have gadgets fixed to them that measure the amount of ozone present in the air. Ozone is important because it blocks out harmful light coming from the sun.

A huge lizard-like creature was hiding in the bushes. It was still as a statue, from the tip of its snout to the curve of its tail. Only its sharp eyes moved, darting left and right. Its nostrils twitched as it smelled dinner. A juicy little insect! The giant lizard got ready to pounce when . . . Suddenly, the ground rumbled and shook. Animals were running in all directions. The poor lizard-creature was almost run over. Angrily, it turned back to see what was causing all the confusion. GULP! A terrifying beast was charging down the forest path. It was taller than the tallest trees, and had skin as rough as rock. Oh no! Was the hunter about to become the prey? This is NOT a story. Such creatures actually lived on Earth a long, long time ago. A time when there were no humans or dogs or birds. Instead there were mammoths, dinosaurs, giant insects, and even ferocious fish-like creatures in the oceans. There were also strange-looking plants different from those we have today. How do we know this? Because of science. A very special branch of science called Palaeontology (pronounced pay-lee-on-tol-oji). Palaeontology is the study of plants and animals that lived on Earth many, many years ago. And paleontologists are scientists who study this science. Just as the ruins of an old palace can tell us things about a king from the past (like how grand his throne was, or what his favourite weapon was), there are clues deep inside the earth that can tell us many things about ancient animals. The clues come in many formsbones, footprints, eggs, and sometimes even the body of an entire animal preserved in stone! These animals lived millions and millions of years ago, long before apes or humans appeared on Earth! How did their remains not rot and decay? And how are they still preserved? Well, when these creatures died and as they rotted, they got buried under layers and layers of soil. The skin and flesh decayed and disappeared, but the hard bones and teeth remained because of the tightly packed soil. All these layers of soil, along with the bones, became hard and turned into rock. Plant and animal remains preserved as imprints in this rock are called fossils. When scientists first discovered huge bones buried under the surface of the earth, they did not know what these were. The bones were larger than any animal they had ever known. Bones as long as tree trunks, skulls the size of autorickshaws, teeth as big as ice-cream cones, and claws like knives! They kept putting the bones together in different ways to see if they could come up with an animal they recognised. Finally, it all clicked into place, like a puzzle. Paleontologists can tell a lot about an animal from its skeleton. For example, if the bones of the legs are much larger than the bones of the forelimbs, it is possible that this animal walked on two legs. Just like that gigantic creature we met earlier! That fearsome creature is called Tyrannosaurus Rex (T.rex for short). If the bones of all the legs are equal in size, there is a good chance that this animal walked on all fours like the Diplodocus which had four stout legs and a really long neck. Fossils of their teeth give great clues about what ancient creatures liked to eat. Many skeletons had long, sharp teeth which are good for eating meat. Some skeletons had flat, broad and smooth teeth good for chewing leaves and the bark of trees. They were good for chewing leaves and the bark of trees. So we know that there were some vegetarian dinosaurs too! But scientists dont always find entire skeletons. They discover only a few bones a finger here, a rib there, or maybe just a couple of bones from the spine. Not all fossils are bones. Some are just marks, like footprints we leave when we walk on soft mud. Dinosaurs left footprints too, and before these prints could disappear, the soil got covered with layers of sand and rock. So the prints stayed intact for millions of years. In fact, by measuring the distance between footprints, paleontologists can guess the height of the animal. They can also tell how it stood and walked. Some of the strangest fossil marks were left by plants. Paleontologists have discovered interestingly-shaped leaves and flowers that cannot be seen anywhere today. But heres the most fun clue of all! Any idea what this might be? Is it a football? Is it a cannonball? Is it an egg? Thats right! Its an egg! A giant, fossilized egg. Scientists have found whole eggs that even contain the outline of an unhatched baby dinosaur inside! Perhaps they got buried in a landslide or lava from a volcano before they could hatch. In Mongolia, scientists discovered eggs along with the skeleton of an adult dinosaur in an attacking pose. They thought that the big dinosaur, fancying an omelette for breakfast, had come to eat the eggs. They named it Oviraptor, meaning egg hunter. Soon, they started discovering many fossilized eggs close to Oviraptor skeletons in different poses. They realised that it was actually the parent dinosaur protecting its own eggs, and not trying to eat them! Most unfairly, the name Oviraptor stuck. As you might have guessed, we dont know everything about these creatures yet. There are a lot of clues that dont really fit, and some clues were put together all wrong. Scientists are still trying to figure them out. There is a lot of digging to be done! Would you like to be a paleontologist and help solve some mysteries? What are you waiting for? Grab a shovel! Meet some other fascinating creatures from the past. Woolly Mammoth These animals were related to elephants, and had tusks that were 15 feet long!

She is terrified. Dont worry, says Amma. An adult has at least five litres of blood in their body. Youre a child and even you will have at least three litres! Thats almost 600 teaspoons of blood. The doctor will just need a few drops. As Mukhil dozes off that afternoon, she sees a ghost in a long white coat getting ready to suck her blood. What long teeth it has! Mukhil wakes up cold and shivering. Phew! It's only a dream! In the evening, Amma and Mukhil go to a clinic. Mukhil sees a nurse coming towards her with a long rubber cord. Is he going to tie me up? she yells. The doctor laughs, No, no. This is a tourniquet. Here, sit down and curl the fingers of your left hand into a fist. The nurse ties the tourniquet around Mukhils left arm tightly. The cord is just to help him draw the blood easily, she says. Then the nurse brings out a syringe saying, This will only take a few seconds. Mukhil jumps out of the chair when she sees the needle. Oh Mukhil! You will need to be brave, says Amma. So Mukhil climbs back in and shuts her eyes. The needle goes in. Ouch! Mukhil opens one eye to see the syringe filling up with blood. It is dark red, almost maroon. The nurse slowly pulls out the needle and presses a small piece of cotton to soak up a drop of blood. Bend your arm at the elbow and hold it like that for a few minutes, he says. Is that all? Mukhil asks the doctor, thinking that it wasnt so bad. The blood is now in a small plastic tube. Thats it! You can collect the results tomorrow, replies the doctor, The lab will check your blood to see if everything is alright. On the way home, Amma buys some candied cherries for Mukhil. They are as maroon as her blood. Mukhil eats them all up. The next day, Amma brings home the blood test results. Have I passed? Mukhil asks in a worried tone. Yes, says Amma, The doctor says its just a flu. Youll be fine soon! Mukhil smiles. She is feeling better already. And she can't WAIT to tell her friends at school about how she passed her first blood test! Colourful Blood Human beings and many other animals have RED blood. But some animals have blood of other colours. Did you know that some beetles and the sea cucumber have YELLOW blood? Some worms that live in the sea have GREEN blood and some worms have PURPLE blood. Can you guess the colour of the blood of an octopus? (The answer is on page 17) What's Your Blood Group? Did you know that there are many different groups of blood based on the proteins in your blood? The blood groups are O negative, O positive, A negative, A positive, B negative, B positive, AB negative and AB positive. What is your blood group? Find out if your friend has a different blood group. Answer: Blue""}"

I would never wear it, Mary replied. Josana got up and left. The next morning, Mary waited for Josana. They walked to school together every day. But Josana had left without her. For lunch, Mary had brought the dried fish curry that Josana loved. But Josana ate with Caroline instead. That evening, Mary waited for Josana at home. She wanted to play with the toy cars that the two of them had built with her father. But Josana didnt come. Mary looked at all the things she had built with Josana in the yard: the flute, the bird house, and the train track. She put her cars aside. She pulled two thick bamboo poles and laid them side by side. She lay a thinner pole across the two and tied it with cane, like she had seen her father do. She tied another pole in the same way, in the opposite direction. She placed many smaller poles one after the other and tied each of these down. Then she dusted her hands, and looked at what she had built. A long, messy rectangle! Jo sana would have enjoyed building this, Mary thought. Mary tried lifting the rectangle and placing it on her shoulders. She stumbled. She tried again. This time it was easier. Where to? Samuel, her elder brother, asked. To Josanas, Mary replied. There was Josana, in her usual spot. Mary scrambled up a tree near Josana. Go away! said Josana, frowning. Samuel climbed up and sat next to Mary. He gave her a rope to hold, and held one himself. Samuel and Mary took a deep breath, and pulled the rectangle up with all their might. KIRRRRICK-KIRRRRICK. PHEW! They then made it lie flat between them. When Mary reached the other side, Josana was still frowning. Her eyes moved from Mary to the rectangle, and then back to Mary. Do you think we can build a train to run on this? Josana asked, breaking into a smile. From Here to There Mary builds a small bridge to reach her friend Josana. If their bridge is fixed onto the trees on both sides, this becomes a beam bridge. A beam bridge is the simplest type of bridge to build. These bridges may be big, made of steel and concrete, or they could be small, made of wood and stones. Have you ever spotted a beam bridge?'}"

He opened his wings for the first time, and flapped them up and down very fast. 220 times in one second, to be exact! WOW Im flying! he shouted. Droso looked down at the rotten banana on which he was born. What a view! His sister Phila was finding her wings too. How high can I fly? Droso wondered, and flew a little higher. Phila liked going up too, but not as much as she liked to pose. One leg here, two legs there, and the other three over there. She posed in different ways. I want to be a model, she announced. The next day, Droso flew to the top of the fruit basket. The day after that, he made it to the top of the refrigerator. Higher and higher Droso flew, until ... he hit the ceiling. He couldn't fly any higher! You see, Droso and Phila were inside Richa's house. Richa was an astronaut. In two weeks, Richa would sit in a rocket and shoot up into space. She had been so busy planning her trip, that she hadnt noticed her bananas rotting. Richa the astronaut was not so different from Droso the fruit fly. Like Droso, Richa also wanted to go to higher places. Flying to space had always been Richas dream. And it was about to come true. How exciting! All Richa thought about was space! Space begins a hundred kilometres or so above the Earth. It has no air to breathe and no ground to stand on. There is no up and no down! So in space, nothing falls down. Astronauts like Richa just float around. What a strange place! Richa often wondered, How would birds fly in a place like space where there is no up and no down? There was only one way to find out. Ill take a bird with me to space! she decided. B ut which one? A pigeon, perhaps? No, it has too many feathers. A crow? Too big. A sparrow? Too noisy. Also, it eats too much. Richa thought long and hard until she got very hungry. She reached for the fruit basket. Yuck, rotten fruits! And thats when she saw Droso and Phila buzzing around. Fruit flies! cried out Richa. They are perfect for space! She put Droso and Phila in a jar. She also put some rotten banana goop in the jar for them to eat. Then, she threw out the rotting banana peel and made herself a sandwich. Today is the day that Richa flies into space. Look at what is in her hand! Phila is the first ever space model. Astronauts take many photos of her eating and resting in space. And Droso? Richa and her scientist friends closely watch how he uses his wings in space. Look! Droso the fruit fly is finally going high, high, high... higher than any other fly in the world. Animals in Space Drosophila is the scientific name of the fruit fly. The fruit fly was the first animal to travel to space. This happened in 1947. Did you know that fruit flies and humans have some things in common? They can remember things just like us, and they even fall sick like we do! Which is why scientists love to study fruit flies in space. After all, it's easier to send flies to space than humans! And this is why fruit flies are known as model organisms. Do you know who else has been to space? Albert the monkey, Laika the dog, Ham the chimpanzee, and Arabella the spider!""}"

PAAA! she called out. Pa ran into the kitchen. He hurriedly picked up a basket of peas and started to shell them. Pa had never gone to school. So Diya had taken it upon herself to teach him. Of all the subjects, Pa enjoyed geography the most. He liked topics related to farming - soil, crops, rainfall, rivers and maps. (Map of India on pg 5 not to scale. Artistic representation only.) But today was Maths Day. Pa, you cant run away from maths, said Diya. Pa continued to shell peas. Maths is very important, Pa. Well be learning division today. Diya, Im busy. Cant you see? said Pa. Pa was always busy on Maths Days. He would suddenly have to clean the house or paint the walls or write letters to distant relatives. I have to cook dinner, said Pa. Okay, Pa. Ill help you. Give me some pea pods, said Diya. Pa gave her half the pods. See, you just did division! said Diya. She counted the pods. There were a total of 20 pods and you divided them into 2 parts. Thats 10 each. Now, if I divide 20 pods into 4 equal parts, Ill get 5 in each. Look, said Diya as she moved the pods into 4 groups. So 20 divided by 4 is equal to 5. Thats not difficult, said Pa. No Pa, its not difficult. Remember when Ramu Kaka and you brought back our share of the rice from the farm? asked Diya. We divided the sacks, and each of us got 6 sacks, said Pa. Correct. There were 31 sacks in all for 5 families. 30 divided by 5 is equal to 6. And we had 1 sack left, which we poured equal portions of into 5 vessels, said Diya. So, division is like sharing something? asked Pa. Yes! Division is exactly that. We can even share time. In the morning, we have 30 minutes to use the bathroom. 30 minutes divided by 3 is 10 minutes. So you, Ma and I each gets 10 minutes. But you take much more than 10 minutes, and I have to manage with lesser, frowned Pa. Diya smiled. Maybe youre right. But in maths, division is sharing equally. We can divide work too. If we have to cook 3 dishes for dinner, each of us can cook 1 dish, said Diya confidently. Diya saw Pas face light up. She felt like she had won a battle. But today I will cook all 3 dishes, said Pa, with a mischievous grin. He was hoping to escape the maths exercises that were sure to follow! Diya laughed. But I want to cook too! What if we divide the work between us? So Ill cook one dish and you cook the other. For the third one, we can divide the work between us. Correct, teacher? asked Pa. Correct, student, replied Diya. Did You Know? The ancient Egyptians knew how to divide, and are likely to have used division in the planning and construction of the pyramids. However, they didnt use the symbol that we use, which is called the obelus (). The first use of the obelus as a symbol for division was first seen in a book called Teutsche Algebra by Johann Rahn published in the year 1659. The Chinese used their own version of the abacus called the suanpan (or calculating pan) to do division, until calculators became widely available. Scientists say that we end up doing maths tasks like division while learning how to play musical instruments such as the guitar or the violin.'}"

Chikki and Ninu, who were playing outside, came running in. Daddy was already at the table. What are we having? asked Ninu. Mooli parathas, said Mummy. And raita. Chikki wrinkled her nose. Yuck! she said. Daddy frowned. Never say that about food, Chikki. It smells, said Chikki. Chikki, Chikki, dont be picky! chanted Ninu, as he gobbled up a paratha. He loved all kinds of food but his sister was fussy. Chikki, dont you want to be an astronaut? asked Mummy. Yes, agreed Chikki. Mummy was a scientist and Daddy had been a fighter pilot. Chikki wanted to study science. And then some day fly higher than Daddy! She wanted to be like the people who fly high into space and are called 'astronauts' or 'star sailors'. Well, said Mummy, I have an idea. If you eat your parathas today, I'll make astronaut food for you tomorrow. Okay! said Chikki happily and wolfed down her paratha. The next day, Chikki and Ninu came back from school for lunch. They were eager to see what Mummy had made. I hope astronauts eat cake and ice cream, said Ninu. And pizza and panipuri, piped Chikki. Instead, they saw a tube on their plates. Toothpaste! cried Ninu. Is that what astronauts eat? Not toothpaste, Mummy smiled. I mashed up rice and dal and put it in the tube. You can squeeze it into your mouth. Why cant we have rice and dal on the plate instead? asked Chikki. Daddy had some on his plate. And it suddenly looked delicious. Daddy pointed to his food. See how it stays on my plate? In space, it would float away. Chikki and Ninu imagined bits of rice floating in the air. Nom-nom-nom, said Ninu as he pretended to catch the grains. Watch out, rice, Im coming for you! It looks like fun, but it would take very long to finish eating. And titbits could end up in the spaceships engines and make a mess, said Daddy. But why does food float in space? asked Chikki. It doesn't float down here! On Earth, we have a force called gravity. It keeps not just food but all of us from floating into space, explained Daddy. That is why when we throw a ball up into the air, it falls back down. Mummy added, Far, far away from Earth, there is almost no gravity. So, astronauts and other things in space weigh next to nothing. They float! And food out there has to be easy to eat and not float away every time someone tries to have lunch! said Daddy. Chikki thought about that for a bit. If gravity pulls everything closer to the ground then, dont we also need it to make our food go from our mouths down to our stomachs? So how do astronauts eat? Wont the food float back to their mouths when they try to swallow? Good question! said Daddy. When human beings started going into space, scientists wondered about that too. The first experiment they did was to have John Glenn, an astronaut, swallow some water. And could he? asked Ninu. 'Imagine not being able to drink water!' he thought. Yes! said Daddy. It turns out that we can swallow because of the muscles in our food pipebetween the mouth and the stomachand not because of gravity. That is why we can even eat upside down, though the muscles have to work harder against the gravity. Chikki and Ninu looked at each other. This was an experiment they had to try! Be careful, warned Daddy, who knew what they were planning. You should not eat or drink too much when you are upside down. Gravity is a pretty strong force. Chikki looked at the tube on her plate. So this is what astronauts eat? She was disappointed. Mummy smiled. When they first started going into space, astronauts ate meat and fruit pastes from tubes. This was not very tasty. So they complained, like you! she said. So scientists tried to come up with options that looked and tasted more like regular food. Today, astronauts get canned food, nuts, granola bars...anything they can eat in a single bite without leaving pesky crumbs. Space shuttles also have small kitchens with ovens where the food can be reheated. So Indian astronauts take fish and paneer curry, and other tasty dishes. What about pizza and ice cream and soda? asked Ninu. Scientists have been trying to send pizza to space for a long time. Making and baking dough in space is difficult, but a team of astronauts made pizza by using flatbread, sauce, and toppings. There are no freezers in space for ice cream, said Daddy. And the bubbles in soda behave in strange ways because of the lack of gravity, said Mummy. But astronauts eat lots of different foods, said Daddy, even fruit like apples and bananas. And scientists are trying to figure out a way to grow vegetables in space. And now, said Mummy, with a twinkle in her eyes, you have to try these gobi parathas. Oh no! said Chikki. But when I become an astronaut, Im going to take panipuri along! Did you know? Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarins first meal in space in 1961 was beef and liver paste. Then he had chocolate sauce. Astronauts in Russia are called cosmonauts, and Indian astronauts are called vyomanauts! Astronauts live in space stations that orbit the earth. A space station is about the size of three houses and has a kitchen, bathroom, study and sleeping areas. Salt and pepper are used in liquid form in space! Astronauts attach containers to special trays using Velcro. They also fasten their trays to their laps, so they can eat while sitting down. Astronauts drink from pouches with special nozzles. If they used cups, their coffee, tea or juice would become a ball and float around the cabin. Since we dont make a lot of saliva in space, food tastes bland. That is why astronauts love spicy food! Astronauts choose what they eat. Food packages are labelled so they do not get mixed up.""}"

He lived in the faraway city of Cuttack. \'We\'ll play outdoors, ride cycles, swim in the pond, pluck mangoes... we\'re going to have so much fun,\' she thought. But Ravi was going to travel on his own for the first time. She had given him directions over the phone. ""Walk straight from the bus stand, straight, straight, and then you\'ll see the pond, keep walking straight, then take a right... no, no, take a left and keep walking for about... hmm... three minutes... when you reach the post-office, take a left there..."" Divya was sure Ravi was confused. She was worried. How would he find her place? Then she had an idea. \'I\'ll make a map for Ravi,\' she thought. \'That will help him find his way.\' She took out a pencil and a large sheet of paper from the cupboard. First, she drew her house, and herself next to it. Then she went outside. One by one, she started drawing other buildings and streets. At the market, Binoy uncle and Sarita aunty sat in their shop. ""What are you doing, Divya?"" asked Binoy uncle. ""I\'m drawing a map of our town,"" said Divya. ""Ooh, how exciting,"" cried Sarita aunty. ""Are we in it?"" She and Binoy uncle came out to look at the map. ""You are right here,"" said Divya. She drew a bright yellow square with Binoy uncle and Sarita aunty beside it. Then Divya crossed the road and reached the big banyan tree next to the ISPAT hospital. Ramesh, who always sat there, called out, ""Hello Divya. What are you up to?"" ""I\'m making a map."" ""Really? You should add me. Under the banyan tree."" Divya laughed, but he was right - Ramesh under the banyan tree was a common sight. So she drew them too. Divya continued on her way. By the post office, she saw Mohan uncle, the postman, getting off his bike. ""Hello Divya, what are you doing?"" he asked. ""She is making a map! And we\'re all in it!"" said Ramesh who had followed Divya. ""Oh?"" said Mohan uncle. ""Don\'t forget the post office."" Divya drew a red rectangle for the post office. Then Divya went southwards. After five minutes, she reached a pond where some women were washing clothes. By now, everyone had heard that Divya was drawing a map. ""Put us in too,"" called Shabnam aunty. Divya drew a large blue pond, with the women by it. Some children had gathered at Divya\'s side. ""Come with me,"" she said, leading them home. ""I\'ll show you something."" Divya led them to the terrace. They looked down at the town. The sun was setting and they could see its reflection in the pond. They looked at the map. Then they looked at the town again. ""Gajapur is so big, but we can show its landmarks in a small map like this,"" said Divya. She was rather happy with her work. ""But how will Ravi know the exact directions from your map?"" asked her friend Kala. Divya looked at the map. ""Ooh!"" she exclaimed. ""I\'ll draw a trail."" ""What\'s a trail?"" Charu wanted to know. ""A trail shows you which route to follow. She coloured the route yellow and added red arrows. It was a cheerful-looking map. Divya folded it, put it in an envelope, stuck some stamps on it and posted it to Ravi in Cuttack. One week later, the doorbell rang. When Divya opened the door, she found Ravi standing outside, holding her map. ""Here I am!"" he grinned. Divya\'s map had worked. Divya can be a cartographer A person who makes maps is called a cartographer. Cartography is a study that combines science, geography, art, and mathematics. Maps help you - See where a town or a city is located - Understand how far places are from each other, maybe even how to reach them - Tell what is special about a place - Give us information about mountains, rivers, deserts, and also the population and natural resources of a place; these are usually shown using symbols and colours Scale When you draw a map, how do you show that a mountain is very tall, or that a house is half the height of a coconut tree? You use a scale. This is the relationship between the size of something on the map and its actual size. A map scale might say that one centimetre corresponds to one kilometre. That means, if you draw a pond that is 2 cm across, you are saying it is really 2 km across. The scale can also tell you how far one place is from another. If the distance between two points is 5 centimetres and the scale is 1 centimetre 1 kilometre, then the actual distance between the two places is 5 km.'}"

At the traffic signal, they saw a man selling bubble-making kits. He dipped a plastic wand into a bottle, took it out and blew into it. A stream of bubbles floated into the air. Some reflected rainbow colours. Ten rupees! he cried out. The light turned green and the bus drove off. Ma, can we buy a bubble kit? said Manu as they had dinner that evening. Ma said, You can make one at home. Why dont you try it tomorrow? That night Manu and Maya dreamt of bubbles. Next morning, Maya mixed shampoo with water in a small red bucket. She carried it to the garden. Manu found some pieces of wire in Babas tool box. He twisted the end of one piece so there was a small circle at one end. He dipped the wand into the soap water and blew into the circle. He blew hard. No bubbles came out. Blow it like this, said Maya, and she blew gently. No bubbles came out. Manu tried again. Ooh! they shouted as a stream of round bubbles floated into the air. Kulfi chased them and barked. I am going to make a different bubble blower, said Maya. She twisted the end of her piece of wire into a square. I bet my bubbles will look like little boxes! she said. Lets make other shapes too, Manu said. Manu made star-shaped and triangle-shaped wands. He was eager to see bubbles of different shapes too. The twins watched Kulfi chasing the bubbles. All of them were... round. How strange! Ma, we tried to make bubbles of different shapes, but they are all round! complained Maya. Round is a special shape, said Sukhwinder Aunty, their neighbour, who was chatting with their mother. She worked at the science museum in the city. When we make bubbles, we blow air into bubble skin. The bubble skin stretches least when it is round. If it is any other shape, the skin will have to stretch more to hold that much air. Bubbles do not like that, added Sukhwinder Aunty. Bubbles are lazy! They dont like stretching! Manu shouted. And he ran off to blow more bubbles with Maya. Classroom Activities How do you make soap bubbles? Squeeze some liquid soap or shampoo into a cup. Add some water to make a soapy solution. To make sure it does not become too watery, add the water in small quantities. Get pieces of wire. Twist them into different shapes. Dip the frame intothe soap solution. Then hold it up. Observe how the soap film clings tothe frame forming a square, circle or triangle according to the frame. Blow gently on the soap film to make bubbles. When the bubbles leave the frame, what do you see? They may start as different shapes, but they always form round (spherical) bubbles! Take a dab of paint from your paint-box. Mix it with the bubble solution. Now blow bubbles! What colour are they? If you are on Earth, the chances are that your bubbles will not come out in a different colour. As the paint is heavier, it is pulled down by gravity and collects in a little blob at the bottom of the bubble. Do you think adding natural colours like beetroot juice to the soap solution will make your bubbles pink? Try it out! The seven year old daughter of a Japanese astronaut asked her mother to find out whether she could make coloured bubbles in space. The mother mixed some red fruit juice with the bubble solution. And guess what, she got red bubbles! Why? Because there is no gravity in space, the colour pigment did not collect at the bottom of the bubble. Why do bubbles burst? A bubble is a bit of air wrapped in a very thin skin. This skin is made up of three layers: soap on the outside, water in the middle, and soap again on the inside. As the water evaporates, the bubble bursts.'}"

Reach out for a cell phone? Or use a landline plugged to a wall? Perhaps the one in the post office or the phone at the grocery store, where you pay the shopkeeper to use it? Whichever it is, the way you make the call remains the same: you enter the number and wait for it to ring. But it wasnt always this simple. Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in the 1880s. He made the first call on March 10, 1876, in his office in Boston, USA, to his assistant Thomas Watson. Bell shouted into the mouthpiece, asking Watson to come and see him. The assistant heard Bell through his earpiece and came running from the next room. At that time, the telephones did not have dials - the two phones were directly connected to each other by a wire! As more people began to get telephones, a central place called an exchange was set up. The exchange had a switchboard connected to every telephone in the area. An operator could plug in the wires on a switchboard to connect any two phones. A switchboard looked like this. And the telephones looked like this. They had a separate mouthpiece to speak into and an earpiece to listen from. They still didnt have number dials! How did you make calls then? Hello! How may I help you? Operator, could you please connect me to Doctor Andrew? One moment. First, you picked up the receiver. A telephone operator would greet you. The operator would then plug in a few wires and the doctors phone would start ringing. But you had to be mindful of what you said, because the telephone operator could listen to your conversation if she wanted to. As the number of telephones grew, it was not possible for an operator to know all the connections. So telephones were designed to have dials. You dialled a number instead of telling the operator to connect you. This number would get transmitted to a switchboard that could automatically connect telephones. However, operators still routed long-distance calls. In the late 1920s, the design of the phone changed. What changed? The mouthpiece and the earpiece were fused into a single handset. You could hold the handset in one hand, or cradle it between your neck and shoulder, leaving your hands free to write or wear your watch. Soon, people wanted to make calls on the move. No, they didnt have cell phones yet. But you could stop on the street and call someone from public telephone booths. By the 1930s, many major cities across the world had such booths. In fact, this is how most people made calls. Only very rich people had telephones at home. Some years later, people wanted to use telephones while driving. So phones complete with handsets and dials were built into cars. But these car phones had no wires! They used radio waves to connect to other phones. In the 1970s, a few people had phones that they could carry around in their bags. This was the satellite phone. It could connect to other phones using satellites. Satphones were never popular because they needed a clear line-of-sight to a satellite in the sky. So if you lived on the second floor of a 20-storey building, you would have to go up to the terrace to make or receive calls. Cell phones began to be used at around the same time. These did not need a straight connect with a satellite. They connected to a tower nearby. So you could make calls sitting inside your house or office. The first cell phone, made in 1973, weighed more than one kilogram! Later, it got smaller and smaller until it could fit into your pocket. A cell phone is convenient in other ways too. Landline phones have to be connected with wires. This means a lot of digging to lay cables across and between towns. Since this also requires money, many villages did not have phones. But the wireless cell phone has changed that. Nearly everyone has a cell phone now. Todays cell phones are for more than just making calls. You can chat, play games, send emails, browse the internet, listen to music, watch movies, click photos and record videos, download apps... What we call a smartphone is really a computer that can also make calls. What else could a phone of the future do? Today, you can speak out your friends name and your phone will call her up. Maybe one day you would be able to tell your phone, Find me the number of my third standard math teacher, and it would! The phone might be able to beam out three-dimensional images of objects. So you can look at a school bag from every side before you buy it online. On the inside too! I also imagine these phones as bendy. You can wrap them around your wrist or roll them up to fit a tiny purse. And charging! There has to be a better way to do that. Solar cells would be great you would only have to be out in the sun to charge it. Or motion-based charging. This would use kinetic energy, which means that the phone would keep getting charged as long as it was on the move. If the battery was dying, you could take a quick run down the road. The phone would get charged and you would get some exercise. Smartphones become outdated very quickly! Most people throw away their phones in one or two years to buy newer ones. That means a lot of waste. How nice it would be if phones were earth-friendly. No harmful radiation, no toxic materials all reusable or biodegradable parts. Now, thats really smart technology! Now, tell me, what do you think phones will be like in the future? Inventor and Teacher Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. Other scientists also worked on similar inventions. Bells parents inspired him to learn about sound and speech. His father was a professor of elocution. Alexanders mother was almost completely deaf, but she learnt to play the piano. Alexander used to speak close to her forehead so that she could feel the vibrations and make out the words. He later started a school for the deaf in Boston. Throughout his life, Alexander kept discovering new ways to communicate. He had 18 patents to his name. His first invention, as a 16-year-old, was a machine to remove husk from wheat grains. Bell was fascinated by the way sound travels through vibrations. If you place your fingers on your throat and speak, you can feel the vibrations of your vocal chords that make the sound. When someone speaks, the vibrations reach your ears and make the eardrum vibrate. Thats how you hear things. As people move farther away, the vibrations become weaker and fade out. See the Sound! -An experiment Things you need: - 1 bowl - Plastic cling wrap - A few grains of rice - A steel plate and spoon Steps: 1. Take the bowl and stretch a plastic cling wrap tightly over it. Make sure it doesnt sag. 2. Sprinkle a few grains of rice on the plastic film. 3. Take the steel plate and spoon, go close to the bowl with the plastic film, but dont touch it. 4. Start hitting the plate with the spoon. But be careful not to touch the bowl! What do you see?'}"

His bright eyes sparkled as he and his friends, Mandra and Bedomi, flew around the street lights. The light drizzle did not seem to bother the insects flying around. This suited the young insect-eating bats just fine. Pip simply loved mosquitoes for dinner. Yum-yum-yum! I got another one! he sang. The three friends were having a competition who would eat the most mosquitoes in one hour! Half an hour into the hunt, Pipsqueak had already caught a hundred and fifty insects. This was going to be a good night. Suddenly, there was a ringing in his ears and he started to drop towards the ground. Bedomi, a bigger bat, swung by his side. Whats the matter, Pip? Are you all right? she asked. Nooo, my ears! cried Pip in distress. He spiralled down to the nearest branch and hung upside down. Ow, ow...They hurt! Mandra set off to fetch Pipsqueaks mother and Bedomi stayed behind to comfort Pip. Pipsqueak was feeling very strange indeed. He felt dizzy. His ears twitched and every movement was painful. Bedomi used her powerful ears to scan the air for Pipsqueaks mother. She was worried that Lyra, the bat who fed on birds, frogs, reptiles and injured bats, might attack Pip. She covered him with her furry wing. Soon, Mandra returned with Pips mama who took him to the doctor. Doctor Ella looked at his ears closely. She shook her head, and said, Your ears have become too cold, Pip. Dont you know that we Pipistrelles dont do well in the rain? Pipsqueak started to mumble in protest, Its just drizzling, not raining But the doctor slipped some medicine into his mouth for the pain. Then she pulled out a chart. Our ears are very important, Pipsqueak, because we use echolocation to find food. Do you know what that means? Pip shook his head. He was already feeling a little better. We insect bats send out signals through our noses. These signals bounce off objects and become echoes. And the echoes come back and tell us what that object is, the doctor continued. Oh, yes! The echoes are all different. If they show that theres an insect, we catch and eat it. But if it is a tree or a wall, we avoid flying into it, said Pip excitedly. Mama says our ears are like radars! Pipsqueak was no longer in pain, and was enjoying this little lesson. Yes! agreed Dr. Ella. Humans use radars in airports, ships and submarines to find objects. And we use our senses to find food. Our noses and ears are so powerful that we dont really need to use our eyes too much. Thats why we have such small eyes, you know. Is that why humans shriek when we go near them? They think we are blind and may get stuck in their hair, ha ha! Thank you, Doc, said Pip. You are welcome, Pip. Now, remember, no more hunting tonight. You can beat your mosquito-hunting record tomorrow, said Doctor Ella, grinning. Pipsqueak and Mandra Pipsqueak and Mandra are tiny bats their scientific names are Pip istrellus tenuis and Pipistrellus coro mandra . They live close to humans the cracks of buildings, below roof tiles, under window ewes, behind photo frames and in tree holes. Bedomi Bedomi is a Lesser-woolly Horseshoe Bat found in the forests of India and Sri Lanka. Its scientific name is Rhinolophus beddomei . Lyra Lyra belongs to the family of bats called Megaderma lyra . These carnivorous bats are also known as False Vampire Bats. Doctor Ella represents all Pipistr ella s , a genus of bats. We cant hear them Bats make clicking sounds that humans cannot hear. Scientists use a detector to listen to the high-pitch call of a bat on a computer. The sound waves from bats bounce off solid objects. These create echoes. Just like Pipsqueak, radars in submarines also use echolocation to navigate underwater. In seawater, sound travels over four times faster than in air. Amazingly, some people who have lost their sight have gained the ability to use their sense of hearing more and use echolocation to find their way around. We need our bats Bats are the only flying mammals. There are 1,116 species of bats, and they all fall under the order Chiroptera. This word is Greek for hand wing. There are two kinds of bats - insect eaters and fruit eaters. Bats are found almost all over the world. In the Western Ghats alone, where Pip and his friends play, we know of 52 species. Bats help keep pests under control, and in spreading seeds so that trees can grow. Unfortunately, bats are at the risk of extinction. This is partly because people mistakenly believe they are pests. Scientists make Red Assessment Lists that tell us which animals are getting extinct and how we can save them. 1. Rhinolophus beddomei - Photo credit: Dr. Sanjay Molur 2.

Suvi rushed into her grandmothers arms. It was a warm night and the stars lit up a cloudless sky. Paati was visiting Suvi this summer. Shall we continue with the Ramayana? asked Paati. Yes! said Suvi. Paati had already told her about the war where Rama defeated Ravana, the king of Lanka. Now Paati picked up from where she had left off. After Ravana was killed, Rama had to return to Ayodhya, his kingdom far, far away. So Vibhishana, the new king of Lanka, gave him a magic chariot. It was called Pushpaka Vimana and could fly on its own. How did it know where to go? asked Suvi. Oh, the traveller just had to give it a command, said Paati. Thats just like a driverless car! said Suvi. Paatis eyes grew round. She said, A car without a driver! What is this amazing thing? A car that can drive on its own, sang Suvi. I dont believe it! said Paati. How can a car drive by itself? By magic? Not magic, Paati, said Suvi. Science! Then tell me, asked Paati, how does this driverless car work? Suvi wasnt sure. She turned on the computer to look it up. While she was trying to connect to the internet, Suvi asked, Do you drive, Paati? I used to ride a scooter many years ago, she replied. But now Im scared to even walk on the streets. Im afraid I will bump into somebody or get hit! Suvi and Paati were looking at the screen. One website said driverless cars were also called self-driving cars. And theres a computer, just like this one, inside each car, said Suvi, patting the desktop. And cameras and sensors. The computer uses these to make a picture of the road around the car. This picture, she went on, tells the car how far away other objects are. Like a tree or a road divider. That way, the car can avoid crashing into them. The same sensors also show the car where and how to park. But how does the car know where it is and where to go? Paati wondered. The cars computer has maps in it, which tell it where it is. When we give it an address, these maps can figure out how to get us there, Suvi explained. Just then, Appa came in. He looked very tired. Whats the matter? asked Paati. Traffic is a nightmare! Appa grumbled. Everybody is in a hurry, nobody follows the rules. If everyone was in a driverless car, this wouldnt be a problem! Suvi said. Paati turned to her in surprise. Suvi continued, The engineers who build the cars computer put all the traffic rules in it. So when the computer makes a decision, it checks to see if the car is following the rules. Hmm said Paati. Lets say the car starts moving when the traffic light turns green but someone crosses the street suddenly. Wouldnt the car hit them? A human driver might be able to stop the car. I had to do that today! said Appa. A man speaking on his phone wandered across when the pedestrian light was red. I stopped just in time. Phew! My goodness! said Paati, looking worried. The self-driving cars first rule, said Suvi, reading from the screen, is not to hit anything or anybody. So even if the traffic rule says the car can go, its sensors will stop it if theres something in front. Are you saying the computer understands that not hitting anything is more important? asked Paati. Exactly! replied Suvi. But can a computer make the car stop faster than a driver can? Oh yes, Paati, said Suvi. It can make decisions much faster than a human being can. And it never gets tired or sleepy. And I am sure computer-controlled cars would never try to break the rules to get ahead like many drivers do, said Appa. Did you know drivers mistakes are responsible for almost 90 of car accidents? Then he added cheerfully, In a driverless car, I could work or push my seat back and relax while the car does its job. Safer roads and fewer accidents mean less worry, said Paati, looking at Appa fondly. I dont know if our Pushpaka Vimana stories are fact or fiction, but science is truly magical! Did you know? 1. The earliest idea for the driverless car can be traced to Leonardo Da Vinci, the famous Italian painter, sculptor, and inventor. In the 15th century, he sketched a blueprint of a cart that could move on its own. In 1925, a car was guided through traffic in New York City via radio signals sent from another car following close behind. 2. Self-driving cars are still being tested by computer and car companies. Some such cars can be found on the roads of Western countries. But someone is always in the drivers seat to make sure there are no accidents. 3. In India, plans are underway to allow similar testing of driverless cars. But with so many people and so much traffic on our roads, this is going to be a challenge! 4. Over one million people in the world die in car crashes every year. Imagine how many lives driverless cars could save. 5. Driverless cars can see and drive in complete darkness, thanks to their maps and sensors. 6. Some existing cars already have features like automatic braking, lane keeping and cruise control.'}"

But whenever there was a wedding in the neighbourhood, he howled woefully, until Anas uncle stopped playing his violin! Ana loved Mando. She knew he would always protect her from strangers and dangers. And from her uncles noisy violin! Mumbai was a noisy city. Ana missed the sounds of the birds, the church bells and the village music. The only thing she didnt miss was her uncles violin! Sometimes, after school, Ana would go with her father as he delivered letters and parcels. Ana would wait eagerly for her ride up in the lift. One day, she sneakily pressed all the buttons. The lift opened on every floor! Every floor had a red speaker box on the wall. Each floor also had a strange-looking shower-head on the ceiling. Who would want to take a bath here? she wondered. Ana tried to figure things out. The red speaker box never played any music. And the shower? Not a drop of water ever dripped from it. It did not even have a tap! One afternoon, while Ana and her father were on the fifth floor at Manju Aajis door, they heard the most horrible wailing. Papa, whats that terrible noise? I think thats the fire alarm, Ana. Come, we must get to the fire escape floor immediately. Ana looked at all the people who had rushed to the safety point. Dont worry Ana, its a very small fire on the second floor. Do you hear that siren? Thats the fire engine - its here to help us. Suddenly, the strange shower began to spray water all around. Oh, and who was that in the corner? Manju Aajis kitten! She was terrified of the fire and the water. The sight of the helpless little kitten made Ana feel brave. She dashed to its rescue. Now that she had gathered some courage, she asked, How did the shower come on, Papa? These are fire sprinklers, Ana. When there is a fire, they turn on automatically, her father said. But where is the tap, Papa? she asked again. Anas father looked at the sprinkler. He wasnt sure. There is no tap, Ana, said Manju Aaji. That red pipe is always full of water and is plugged tight with a bulb. When theres a fire nearby, the bulb heats up and bursts. So the water comes rushing out. Ah, said Papa, who had just learnt something. BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP... A large white ladder rose up right in front of them. Families with children and the elderly, please, a fireman announced into his horn. BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP... A large white ladder rose up right in front of them.

Its a good thing, he said softly. Its a bit like Mando, Papa, Ana whispered back. Her father looked puzzled. The fire alarm is quiet every day. It only makes noise to save us from trouble. Technology helps us in many ways. During a fire, the automatic fire systems in schools, cinema halls and other buildings save our lives. Here are some things we should do when we hear a fire alarm: 1. Get up calmly and walk towards the nearest fire exit at a steady pace. Do not take the lift as lifts are usually disabled during a fire. 2. Running will make you inhale more smoke or may cause an accident or stampede. So do not run; walk fast. If possible, cover your face with a wet towel. 3. Do not throw any water at the fire as this could make the fire spread or cause electrocution. 4. Ask a grown-up to switch off the electrical main switch. Do not touch any electrical appliances or switches. 5. If the exit way is filled with smoke it is better to crawl or creep out so that you inhale less smoke. 6. Once out of the building, walk towards the nearest fire assembly point or safe open area. 7. Wait in one place until your family member or caretaker has found you. 8. If you are injured, request the nearest grown-up for help.'}"

What did he have to do with Muttajjis education? asked Mangala. Oh yes, he was an engineer and built bridges and dams and buildings, but he also did so much more. You know what, tomorrow lets go to Muddenahalli, the place where he was born. The house in the hills In the small village of Muddenahalli, near present-day Bengaluru, is a house surrounded by rocky hills. Here a baby boy was born on September 15, 1860. Next to his house is a small office that he built when he became an engineer. The office is now a museum. Each exhibit tells a story about this engineer Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya. Now thats a really long name! So people started referring to him as Sir MV. His friends called him Vishwa. Off to the city As a young boy, Vishwa had to walk a long way to school. Looking at his precariously frail build, a teacher is supposed to have remarked that he would not live long. But this did not worry young Vishwa or his family. All they wanted was for him to have a good education. When he was 15, Vishwas father passed away. He continued his schooling in Chikkaballapura and Bengaluru, and then studied Arts in Central College. He barely had money. Luckily, a couple took him in. In return for board, lodging and a small sum of money, he tutored their two children. Vishwa graduated in 1881 and got a scholarship to study civil engineering at the College of Science in Pune. He topped the course. When Visvesvaraya graduated from Central College, Bengaluru, Principal Charles Waters presented him with a dictionary. Visvesvaraya used it for the next 80 years! A very thrifty person, he once said in a speech: If you buy what you do not need, you will need what you cannot buy. Riding to work As the university topper, Visvesvaraya was appointed assistant engineer in the Public Works Department of the Government of Bombay. Within months, he built a structure called a syphon to bring water from the Panjra river to a village called Datari. While there, he came to work from the camp office across Panjra river. How did he travel to work? On horseback of course, since this was in 1884! One evening it rained so hard that the river was flooded and Visvesvaraya could not ride back to the travellers bungalow. For two days, the villagers of Nandwan and Datari offered him food and accommodation. But on the third morning, he had to return to the camp office. What did he do? He just swam back with the help of his Bhil workers. Can you imagine how strong he had become contrary to that early prediction? Visvesvarayas public works, which started then, went on for over seven decades! Team clearing sand from the bed of the stream Visvesvaraya was passionate about water conservation. He designed many water supply, drainage and irrigation systems across the country. Visvesvaraya also designed or advised on water supply systems in Aden (now in Yemen), Kolhapur, Indore, Gwalior, Bhopal, Nagpur, Goa, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Baroda, Sangli and across Bihar and Odisha. 1894 Service in Sind: Designed a water filtration system on the riverbed to supply clean water to Sukkur, in Sindh, now in Pakistan. 1889 New Irrigation System : Designed a system of irrigation for the Bombay Presidency that could distribute water to large blocks of land and increase the output of crops. It was called the Block System of Irrigation. 1908 Drainage for Hyderabad: Cyclonic rains caused the Musi river to flood. Thousands of people were killed. The Nizam of Hyderabad invited Visvesvaraya to design a drainage and water supply system to prevent such losses. Automatic Sluice Gates: The Khadakvasla reservoir, Punes water source, would overflow every monsoon. But the water that it could hold wasnt enough for the summer. Visvesvaraya designed a system of automatic gates that increased the capacity of the reservoir, which he patented as the Automatic Sluice Gates. Similar systems were installed in Tigra dam, near Gwalior, and Krishna Raja Sagar dam, near Mysuru. Patent: A government authority or licencse conferring a right or title for a set period, especially the sole right to exclude others from making, using, or selling an invention. The Mysore years In 1909, after he finished his work as a consulting engineer in Hyderabad, Visvesvaraya received a telegram from the Dewan of Mysore offering him the post of Chief Engineer. But Visvesvaraya was no longer interested in routine work. So he asked if he could work on developing industries and technical education in the state. The government agreed. Sri Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, the Maharaja of Mysore, asked him to design a dam across the river Cauvery. Previously, Visvesvaraya had visited large irrigation projects like the Aswan Dam in Egypt. He had observed how engineers there worked and came up with a design for the Krishna Raja Sagara Dam. Built over many years, it is a spectacular construction and thousands of people still visit it every day. In 1912, when KRS Dam was built, it supplied power to the Kolar Gold Fields it had a tunnel that was nearly 3 km long, bored through a hill range it led to the cultivation of sugarcane, giving rise to large sugar mills in the region it was the largest dam in India Education for all In 1912, the Maharaja offered the post of Dewan to Visvesvaraya. But he was anxious to have opportunities to develop technical education and industries in the State and he did not want any high office. However, the Maharaja insisted, and Visvesvaraya became the Dewan. As someone who knew the worth of a good education, Visvesvaraya wanted to set up schools and colleges. During his period as Dewan, between 1912 and 1918, the number of educational institutions in the state went up from just 4,568 to 11,294. The Maharanis College in Mysuru became the first in the state to include degree courses for women. Visvesvaraya was also responsible for starting technical education colleges, engineering colleges and agriculture education. He introduced compulsory education, which is now a fundamental right in the Indian Constitution. On a visit to his old school in Muddenahalli, he gave a packet of chocolates to the students. When he was asked to give a speech, Sir MV spoke only for five minutes because he wasnt prepared. Unhappy with that, he came back a few days later with a well-prepared speech! When he resigned as chairman of the Mysore Iron Works, which he founded, a large sum of money was due to him. Visvesvaraya wanted it to be used to start a college where boys could learn a profession. So the Sri Jayachamarajendra Occupational Institute was set up in Bengaluru. It is now called Sri Jayachamarajendra Polytechnic. The first Ganesha made at the Mysore Iron Works, later renamed Visvesvaraya Iron and Steel Plant. Institutions that Sir MV helped to set up Government Engineering College (Renamed University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering), Bengaluru. Hebbal Agricultural School, that led to the formation of University of Agricultural Sciences. Sri Jayachamarajendra Polytechnic College, Bengaluru Mysore University An honour for the genius By now, Visvesvaraya was recognised for his work as an engineer and a leader in many parts of the country. In 1915, while he was the Dewan of Mysore, the British government made him a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE). From then on, he was called Sir M.Visvesvaraya. The visionary that he was, Visvesvaraya visited factories and big construction projects in many countries, not only to provide them with his services, but also to see how he could bring development to India. He felt Indias poverty could only be reduced if education and employment were available to everyone. He often boldly declared, Industrialise, or perish! But, during the same time, Gandhiji used to say, Industrialise and perish! Even though the two great men did not have the same views about industrialisation, they respected each other. Strong beliefs Visvesvaraya was a very simple man. He focussed almost all his energy and thoughts on nation-building. He believed that all people should be respected for the work they did. During the Mysuru Dasara celebrations, British officers sat on chairs while Indian officers had to sit on the floor or remain standing at the back. Visvesvaraya stopped going to these durbars because of the discrimination. The government noticed this and got chairs for the Indian officers too. A special car ride Once, when Visvesvaraya was quite old, he wanted to go to his village. Chief Minister Kengal Hanumanthaiah said he could take a government car. But as he wasnt going on official business, Visvesvaraya refused. So the CM drove him in his personal car! Team leader Big buildings and structures cannot be built by a single person. Dreamers, researchers, funders, masons, labourers and many others have to work together to build them. Sir MV worked hard and efficiently, inspiring everyone around him to give their best too. Once when he was on a study tour in America, Visvesvarayas host said the group had to climb a four-floor-high ladder to see how a particular machine worked. Everyone was scared. Not Sir MV! He climbed nimbly all the way to the top. He was 85 years old. In his 90s, he was called upon by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to examine several proposals for bridges to be built over the Ganga. He first did an aerial survey of the region. No one expected him to come to inspect the rocky and dangerous terrain. Since Sir MV never did anything without thorough study and preparation, of course he travelled to the region to make notes. Based on the location selected by him, a road-cum-railway bridge was built near Mokama, Bihar. Love for reading Sir MV was always eager to learn. When he was more than a hundred years old, a relative asked him what he wanted from Chennai. Get me a good, modern dictionary, he replied. The dictionary is now in the Muddenahalli museum. Sir MV helped to set up the Mysore Agricultural Residential School. It later became the University of Agricultural Sciences. The rock on which he liked to sit has been named after him. Among the books in his personal library were Poems of Kabir, Arabian Nights, Mark Twains Tom Sawyer Abroad, Charles Dickens The Pickwick Papers, Dr. Peter Schmidts Dont Be Tired, Macmillans Promotion of Happiness and Rabindranath Tagores Stray Birds. Also in the library were books that he wrote: Memoirs of My Working Life, Constructing India, Nation Building: A Five-Year Plan for the Provinces and Prosperity Through Industry. As an engineer, and a person who valued education and discipline, Sir MV was an inspiration to millions of people. Among them was a boy called Ramu who used to read out to him from the newspapers when Visvesvarayas eyesight became weak. He wanted Ramu to come on time, read to him and leave for school on time. For this, Sir MV paid him 10 paise every day. Ramus reading improved and he grew up to become a teacher. After he retired, he became a Scoutmaster in Tumakuru and taught physical exercise, memory games, first-aid and sports to children for free. Mangala and Amma had been learning about Visvesvaraya for a week. Amma, so Muttajji could get a degree because Sir MV introduced graduate studies in Mysuru? Mangala asked. Amma nodded. Ajji had an account in Mysore Bank founded by Sir MV? Amma nodded. You worked at the Kannada Sahitya Parishat? Amma nodded again. And now, I want to visit Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum which was set up in his memory, said Mangala. Yes, lets go there next week, on his birthday! said Amma. Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum September 15 is celebrated as National Engineers Day in honour of Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya, an outstanding engineer and visionary. Visvesvaraya helped set up the Karnataka Sahitya Parishat (later renamed Kannada Sahitya Parishat) in Bengaluru to bring together people who spoke different dialects of the language. --- Sir MVs office turned into a museum.

He loved counting things . After school, he helped his mother weigh vegetables and count money. One evening, Baku saw a pair of colourful birds. They laughed and took off. Baku followed them. They flew through a cave and into the forest. Everything here was so different, just like the birds. Were those blue monkeys whistling? And the pink elephants? They seemed to be humming! Baku didnt see the sun go down. Soon, it got dark, and he was lost. A short distance away, he saw a roaring fire. A woman was pacing up and down. Her name was Midu. Baku went up to her and asked softly, Wha...what is the matter? My ten-year-old daughter Koya came down with a rare illness six months ago. She hasnt been able to sit up since then! Is there no cure? asked Baku. Only onethe nectar of the Neelumbera flower, she said. It blooms every seven days. But only the nectar collected on a full moon night can cure her. In the past six months, the flower hasnt bloomed even once on a full moon night. Koya is getting weaker every day! Bakus mind raced. Please dont cry! The flower will bloom on a full moon night...hmmm...in nine days, he said confidently. How can you be sure? asked Midu. Baku had worked it out. The full moon shone every thirty days and the flower bloomed every seven days. This meant it would bloom on a full moon night once every 210 days - roughly seven months. Six months had gone by. The Neelumbera would bloom on the next full moon night. That was only nine days away. Midu thanked Baku and led him back to his village. Three weeks later, when Baku was picking jamuns, he saw Midu again. She came running and hugged him. Baku! Look, thats my Koya! she said. The flower bloomed on the night you said it would. The nectar worked its magic! Koya was cured. Baku was very pleased. All was well in Midus world. How did Baku work it out? Baku knew the Neelumbera flower bloomed once every 7 days and that the full moon appeared every 30 days. How did he know that the blooming of the flower would coincide with the full moon? Mathematics! Actually, something called Lowest Common Multiple (LCM). What is LCM? The LCM of two numberslets call them a and b is the smallest number which is a common multiple of both a and b . The lunar cyclethat is one full moon to the nextcan last anywhere between 28 and 31 days. The average full moon cycle is 29.53 days, which is rounded off to 30 days. How do you find the LCM? To find the LCM of 3 and 5: Write the multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33... Write the multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35... The common multiples are 15, 30 The least or smallest common multiple is 15! LCM of 3 and 5 is 15. Prime factorization method We usually use this method to find the LCM of larger numbers. This means that we list out each number as a product of prime factors. Lets find the LCM of 20 and 30. First, we write each of the numbers as a product of its prime factors. 20 2 x 2 x 5 30 2 x 3 x 5 Now we multiply all the factors. 2 x 2 x 3 x 5 60 How often does the Neelumbera bloom on a full moon night? The answer to this is the LCM of 7 and 30. 7 7 30 2 x 3 x 5 LCM 2 x 3 x 5 x 7 210 So, the Neelumbera blooms on a full moon night once in 210 days. If a factor is common to both lists, we need to take it only once for each pair, unless it occurs more than once in the same list. Here, 2 is common to one pair, but it occurs twice in the list for 20. Imagine you have planned to serve spicy vada-pav from the neighbourhood snack shop. You go to the shop and realise that vadas come in packets of 3 each and pavs come in packets of 4 each. What is the minimum number of packets you have to buy of each so that you can pair vadas and pavs without either remaining extra? (Hint: LCM will help you here.) Have a great party!'}"

One bag had half a kilo of potatoes, and the other, half a kilo of tomatoes and a sliver of ash gourd. And home was still half a kilometre away. She put the bags down by a shopfront to rest. A balloon seller was walking by, shouting, Balooooneee colour-colour baloooonee. How easily he carried the lot. If only her bags were full of air! Then Lakshmi thought back to her science class. That afternoon, Ammu Miss had said air had weight. One cubic metre of air weighs 1.2 kg, she had said. 1 cubic metre is the volume of a cube that measures 100 cm x 100 cm x 100 cm. That seemed like a lot nearly as heavy as her two bags. If air had weight, wouldnt she feel it? When she got home, Lakshmi decided to find out. Gowri, her little sister, could help her. Lakshmi pulled out twelve sticks from the new broom by the kitchen sink. Using a ruler, she made sure each one was 100 cm long. And she stuck them to make a cube. Lakshmi and Gowri used the cube as a frame and taped up old newspaper till all its sides were covered. Now, this should have 1.2 kilograms of air! Lakshmi thought. Then she lay down under it to check if she could feel its weight. She couldnt feel a thing! But when Gowri put the vegetable bags on Lakshmis chest, she could feel them pressing down on her. Next, Lakshmi blew a balloon and dropped it. If air did have weight, a full balloon should fall faster than an empty one, right? But the balloon didnt fall at all. It floated away. Lakshmi ran behind it. She took the balloon along to the primary health centre. While Gowri was getting a vaccination, Lakshmi stood on the weighing scale in the doctors office she weighed 19 kg. Then she carefully put the balloon on the machine. The needle didnt move. Air has no weight, Miss, she declared in class the next day. You cant feel its weight. You can feel air when it moves, said the teacher, puffing away a strand of hair from her forehead. She pointed towards the leaves dancing in the wind and the grey clouds hiding the sun. And air moves things. As for feeling its weight, said Ammu Miss, lets find out today. She scribbled a note and handed it to a student. Shyam, could you go and get three packets of thick balloons, please? Class, come on, lets clear this place for our experiment. The students moved the chairs and tables to a corner and created space in the middle of the room. Ammu Miss found a cubical cardboard box. She measured its sides and announced, The volume of this box is roughly one cubic metre. Lets blow the balloons and put them into this box. The students huffed and puffed, and scrunched their faces and twisted the balloons for half an hour. Some balloons floated away. Some balloons slowly lost air. PHAT! Some balloons burst. Ammu Miss stood by the box and watched the students fill it up with the inflated balloons. Once the box was full, she tied the balloons together with a string to make a giant ball. Carrying this, the students trooped to the Principals office, where the weighing machine was. Lakshmi stood on it she still weighed 19 kg. As she struggled to hold the giant globe Ammu Miss gave her, the class looked closely at the number below. Did the needle twitch? Yes, it looked like it had moved a little beyond 19 kg. The weight of air can vary a little from place to place. The rubber of the balloon has some weight too. Why do you think the needle moved so little? Do you think the air outside pushing back on the balloon had anything to do with it? Ammu Miss took a pin and poked five of the balloons. Lakshmi was startled, but soon began to laugh. The class cheered as Ammu Miss burst the rest of the balloons. When she finished, the needle on the weighing machine had moved back a little. Lakshmi was happy. It had been proved in class today that air did have weight. Before the bell rang, she had one more question: Miss, if air has weight then why do balloons float when theyre full, and fall when they burst? What do you think? Did you know, there are more air molecules around us in the atmosphere than the total number of grains of sand on all the beaches in the world! Many of these particles collide with us and push against us. How is it that we never feel the weight of these air molecules? From the time we are born, our bodies adjust to the pressure of air molecules on them. Our bodies are made up of bones, muscles, fluids and a lot of air and exert as much pressure outwards against the air molecules. This is why we do not feel the weight of air on us. We only feel it when the air pressure changes, like when we are on a flight or high up on a mountain. Lets play with air! Take an empty mineral water bottle or any other bottle made of thin plastic. Drill a hole in the cap, insert a straw into it and seal it with clay. Or seal the mouth of the bottle with clay and poke a straw through. Now suck in the air through the straw. The bottle crumples. Why? The air outside is pushing against it, and there isnt enough air inside the bottle to push it back with equal force. When there is air outside and inside the bottle, the bottle stays in shape. Take a straw. Cover one end of it with your finger and suck in air from the other side. What do you observe? Can you figure out why the straw crumples?'}"

He loved to read. He also loved to travel. But he hated waiting at airports and train stations, taxi stands and bus terminals. Travel always seemed to take so much time! How I wish I had a magic carpet, he thought. I would whizz from place to place in no time like Aladdin. How did human beings first go from one place to another? They walked. Once they learnt to tame animals, they rode donkeys, horses, camels, and elephants. Hundreds of years passed. The wheel was invented, and bullock carts and other carriages took people everywhere. A few centuries ago, the steam engine was perfected and trains were built. Next came the motor car, and people got to places faster. Cars ran on internal combustion engines. The Wright brothers took this engine and worked on it so that it could power a plane. Engineers took this a step further. They designed rockets to fly humans to outer space and to the moon. But why are we still slower than a magic carpet? Vishnu wondered. He asked his mother. He asked his father. He even asked his teacher. Nobody could give him a satisfactory answer. His father said, We are faster than we ever were. We can go from Chennai to Bengaluru in five or six hours by rail or road. And it takes less than 40 minutes by air. Why, you can even fly from Delhi to Washington in just 16 hours! The Japanese bullet trains take people from one island to another in just a few hours. How much faster do you want to go, Vishnu? How far in 40 minutes? 4 km 40 km 60 km 600 km They dont understand, thought Vishnu. Every time he travelled, he wished he had magical powers that would take him anywhere in an instant. He grumbled about it to Rahul, his best friend. One day, Vishnu saw a newspaper headline that sent his little world into a spin. It said: Hyperloop: the modern day magic carpet. He ran to his friends house. Rahul, the Hyperloop is coming! It is going to be faster than any train or plane, he said. What is that? asked Rahuls sister Anuradha, joining them. Hyperloop is a super, super, SUPER fast mode of transport. I just read about it in the newspaper. Its a system with small vehicles called pods that will carry people through long, massive vacuum tubes. These tubes will rest on columns or be constructed underground. The more Vishnu told Rahul and Anuradha about the hyperloop, the more excited he became. We would be able to go from Chennai to Bengaluru at the speed of a plane in less than 40 minutes! Isnt it great? It takes five to six hours when we go by bus or train. Anuradha was full of questions. How will it move? Is it safe? The pods will go whoosh! Through the tubes... levitating all the while. Safety tests for the hyperloop are being carried out right now, Vishnu said. They will be faster than bullet trains! said Rahul. Really? asked Anuradha. The idea is to work towards the speed of sound, about 1,235 kilometres per hour, said Vishnu. But how? asked a puzzled Rahul. With hardly any air resistance or friction to slow them down in vacuum, the pods can whizz through the tubes. Imagine zipping from Chennai to Bengaluru in a matter of minutes! How awesome is that? They laughed, thrilled with the idea. But tomorrow I have to take a bus to Bengaluru! groaned Vishnu. That night Vishnu dreamt of travelling in the hyperloop... Hyperloop, the dream transport The hyperloop is a futuristic transport system. It is expected to be environment-friendly since the tubes can have solar panels on the roof, allowing for a clean and self-powering system. India is already working on a hyperloop project . It will run from Mumbai to Pune. But the world has seen great inventions because of peoples dreams and imagination. Vishnu dreams a lot. What do you dream about?'}"

Ajji began to pray for rain. Amma collected all the buckets and pots and vessels in the house and filled them up. We need to store as much water as we can, she said. Appa collected tools to dig a little deeper. We just need enough until the rains arrive, he said. Ranj got out her notebook and pencil. She put on her thinking cap, and followed her parents to the tank. She examined the tank bed closely. It was cracked and dusty. Ranj wondered, Where did the water in the tank go? Did it run away? Was it stolen? This is a mystery! Ranj loved solving mysteries: Like the time Ajji couldnt find her reading glasses. Ranj had found them in her book, marking the page she was reading. Then the other time Why were elephants visiting the ragi fields? Turns out it was because their long, long trunks could smell the ripening grains, all ready to eat. Ill find that water, Ranj muttered to herself. Ranj walked to the other side of the tank, past dead fish and dried reeds. Do you know where the water could have gone? Ranj asked a fisherman. Downstream? the fisherman suggested. Ranj followed the dry stream bed down the hill. At the bottom was another tank. It had lots of goats, but no water. Ranj asked the goatherd, Do you know where the water might be? Upstream, the goatherd suggested. Thats where I came from, Ranj said. No water there. Further up, then? the goatherd said. Thats where your water comes from. Ranj climbed up to the tank. Then she climbed up some more to a tank further up the hill. There was no water, no birds. There was only one person there. Sapna, I cant find any water. Any idea where its gone? Ranj called to her. She knew Sapna from school. Downstream, Sapna called back. Ranj was suddenly angry. She stomped her foot. NO! she shouted. Its not. I have searched and searched. Its not upstream or downstream. Got it? How about up there? Sapna suggested. Ranj and Sapna looked up at the sky. The sun glared back at them. Everything was white-hot and dusty. No, they agreed together. No water there. Ranj collapsed into the boat with Sapna and gnawed on a lotus stem. She was hot and tired. Manjus parents left the village, Ranj said. They went to the city where they have water. Maybe we should all go. You go, Sapna snapped. No one asked you to be here. Fine, Ranj said. And she stomped back home. But it wasnt fine! There was still no water, still no rain. The next day, Ranj brushed her teeth with muddy tank water in a tiny glass. Thooo! she spat. In school, the class was half-empty. More families had left the area. Ranj just couldnt bear it. She missed all her friends! In the middle of Environmental Studies class, she turned and ran out of school. She ran and ran until she was panting. She finally sat at the side of the road. I have to find the water! she huffed. Can I help? said a voice. It was Sapna who had seen Ranj running away from school. Ranj beamed. Yes! We have to do this properly, Sapna said. Like real Sanitary Engineers. Like who? Ranj asked. Sanitary Engineers build pipes and tanks and drains. I am going to be one when I grow up, Sapna said. Ranj and Sapna decided to draw a map of their village and all its tanks and streams, showing all the places where the water might have flowed. Where could the water possibly have gone? Finally, they sat back and pored over the map. We havent seen that tank yet, Ranj pointed to one of the tanks they had drawn. Lets go, Sapna agreed. Ranj and Sapna began climbing up the hill. The stream here was dry as well. Maybe we shouldnt have missed school. This tank is probably dry as well, Sapna said sadly. When they reached the tank, Ranj and Sapna realised they were wrong. This tank was full! Sapna pointed at a small pump at the end of the lake. There was a tanker just below the bund, collecting water as it flowed. A man stood by, guiding the tanker. Mystery solved, Ranj spat. She had never felt so angry after solving a mystery. Where are you taking our water? Ranj wanted to know. The city, the man said. They have more people, so they need more water. Thats not fair! Sapna said. The man shrugged, Thats how it is. My friend is a Sanitary Engineer, Ranj yelled. She knows whats fair. The man laughed. Sanitary Engineer it seems! Youre just children! Sapna said quietly, Yes, but I know you cant just take our water away. Go home, the man said. You cant change anything! Well break your pump! Ranj shouted, running at the pump with a stick. Oho! said the man. Shouldnt Sanitary Engineers be building pumps, not breaking them? Yes no not like this Sapna said, unhappily. But Ranj said, Im a detective! I can do what I want. Ranj had a better idea. She hugged the pump. You cant turn it on now! Sapna ran up to hug the pump too. Hey! said the man. Now he was really angry. Just go home, he said. That was when the clouds broke. Thunder roared, lightning slashed, rain poured. Sapna started to laugh. The monsoon is here! Ranj shouted. Im going home, even if you arent, the tanker man said. It rained and rained. WOOSH , the bund overflowed, and the stream rushed down, splashing them. The water has been found! Mystery solved! Ranj said. WOOOOOO! They yowled with joy. Water Words Tank: A name for a man-made place to collect water. Tank sizes can vary from small pools to large lakes. Bund: A small wall usually made of mud or stones to stop and hold water in a tank. Stream: A small channel through which water flows. Spring: A place where underground water comes up to the surface. Water table: Level of water under the ground. Wells have to be dug deep enough to hit the water table to get water.'}"

They lived in a small monastery on a beautiful green hill. Here, it was lovely when it rained. When Tashi looked out of the window late one morning, the rain was coming down hard. Rivulets were forming where the water had made paths on the muddy road. Tashi couldnt think of a better way to spend the afternoon than sailing paper boats. Tashi and Tenzin set about making many paper boats. As soon as it stopped raining, the boys ran outside. They sailed the paper boats they had made some big, some small. The boats floated nicely along the path. The two young monks were happy. As they trotted back home, they saw Gen Lobsang. Genla lived in the monastery and told the children the most wonderful stories. Genla, shouted Tenzin. Can you tell us a story about why boats float? Gen Lobsang thought for a minute and said, I dont know why boats or ships, for that matter float. But I am curious to find out. Genla: A polite way of addressing the teacher in Tibetan Genla and the children decided to go and ask Miss Sonam, the science teacher, if she knew why boats float. Tenzin and Tashi gently pulled Gen Lobsang from his chair. They held his hands to help him walk. When they reached her room, Miss Sonam was reading a book. Tashi delek, said Genla, Tashi and Tenzin. Tashi delek, she replied. We have a question for you, said Genla. Tashi delek: A common Tibetan greeting; tashi means good fortune and delek means well being. Yes, can you tell us what makes boats float on water, Miss? Tenzin asked. I can, said Miss Sonam. Or maybe we can find out together? Before they knew it, Miss Sonam was giving instructions. Tenzin, please bring a plastic basin from the kitchen. Tashi, please fetch a small bucket of water. Genla, hold this apple. Please dont eat it. Miss Sonam asked Tashi to fill the tub to the brim. Now, Genla, she said, dip the apple in the tub, please. Enough to cover it completely in water. Genla gently dropped the fruit into the tub and pushed it down with his little finger. Some water spilled. Tashi and Tenzin shrieked, The water is overflowing! Genla let go of the apple, and it rose up. Miss Sonam was smiling. What happened here? she asked. Genla pushed the apple into the water, said Tenzin. Water spilled, said Tashi. The apples floating, said Genla. Correct answers, all of you! said Miss Sonam. Now, can you tell me how much water spilled, Tenzin? Was it about half a cup? One cup? Tenzin looked at the water on the table and on the floor. He said, Maybe one cup. That sounds right, said Miss Sonam. Genla and Tashi nodded in agreement. Now, take the apple out. Tashi, fill up the tub again. Here, Tenzin. Will you drop this spoon into the water? Tenzin did. The spoon sank to the bottom. Too heavy, said Genla. Not as heavy as a ship in the sea, said Tenzin. Very little water spilled this time, not even a quarter of a cup! said Tashi, a little sad. Again, youre all correct, said Miss Sonam. Then she asked: Do you see? After Genla dropped the apple into the water, the apple pushed some water away before it could float. Is that the water that spilled? asked Tenzin. Yes. So the apple could float because it pushed away more water than its own weight. That means, the apple is lighter than the water it pushed away. What about the spoon then? Genla said. Well, the spoon also pushed some water away. But much less. Certainly less than its own weight. So it sank. What about large ships in the sea, on which there are many people? asked Tenzin. ...and many spoons that sink? added Tashi. The spoons wont make a ship sink, Tashi. The ship is big enough to push away a lot of water. Again, like the apple, more water than its own weight. You dont notice it because in the ocean, there is so much water. The ship is still lighter than the amount of water that it pushes away. They were all quiet for a bit. I think I understand, said Tenzin, slowly. Can we sail some boats now? asked Tashi. Its time for my tea, said Genla. Miss Sonam smiled. Yes, enjoy yourselves! she said, and gave the boys colour paper to make boats. Tenzin and Tashi made more colourful boats and set them down in the water. I dont see any water spilling now, said Tashi. No, silly. The water doesnt always spill. It just gets pushed away, replied Tenzin. I think the boats just make some space for themselves in the stream, said Genla. They watched the blue and yellow boats, red and green boats, and white boats sailing. Like prayer flags floating in the stream. What is Gravity? What would happen if Tenzin dropped a football from the top of a tree? Would it fall to the ground or rise towards the sky? Thats right, it would fall because of a force called gravity. Did you know that everything gets pulled towards the earth by that force? What is Buoyancy? What would happen if Tashi dropped a football into a bucket of water? Would gravity pull the football to the bottom of the bucket? Yes, but in water, there is an upward force that opposes gravity. It is called buoyancy. As gravity tries to pull the football down, buoyancy tries to push it up. In the case of the football, buoyancy is stronger than gravity. So it floats. What would happen if he drops a brick into the bucket? Why? What is Displacement? When you drop an object into water, it tries to make space for itself by pushing some water aside. In other words, the object displaces water to make space for itself. Bigger objects, like a basketball, displace more water than smaller ones, like a cricket ball. A long time ago, a Greek scientist named Archimedes discovered that when the weight of the water displaced by an object is more than the weight of the object, it floats. That is why apples float in water. Can you guess why other objects sink? What is Density? Every object around us is made of tiny particles that cant be seen with the naked eye. Density is how closely these particles are packed in an object. The weight of Tashis small glass marble may be the same as Miss Sonams apple. But why is the apple bigger? Because there is more space between the particles in the apple. In the marble, the particles are much closer to each other. An apple is less dense than a marble. Generally, dense objects sink in water. Heres a game you can play with your friends: Pick four or five objects. Guess which ones will float and which will sink. Then drop them into a bucket or tub of water to check. Have fun!'}"

Every evening, this is what they did with their friends. One day, Arnav said to Tanisha, What fun hide-and-seek would be if I could disappear and no one could see me! They decided to ask Mamma and Papa if it was possible to become invisible. Papa smiled and said, That sounds like science fiction. Mamma designed curtains and cushion covers for peoples homes and knew a lot about different kinds of cloth. She said, I think scientists are working on fabrics that could make the wearer invisible. Ooh, you mean like a real invisibility cloak? asked Tanisha. The children decided to visit the library to find out more about these new-age fabrics. Arnav and Tanisha browsed through shelves and shelves of books to trace the history of fabrics. The oldest fibre that makes up fabric, they found out, is linen. This is made from the stalk of a plant called flax. Cotton is an old fabric too. Like linen, this also comes from a plant. They borrowed some books and left. Cotton Flax At home, Arnav looked at his clothes and said, Mamma, my shorts are thick and my shirt is thin. But arent they both made of the same fabric, cotton? Good question, Arnav, said Mamma. How thick a fabric is depends on the quality of the fibre its made from... ...and the way the fabric is woven, Papa chipped in. Are there other plant fibres? asked Tanisha. Yes, coconut, bamboo, jute are some of them, Mamma replied. There are insect and animal fibres too, added Arnav. Like silk from silkworms and wool from sheep. Tanisha asked, Mamma, I know you are wearing a silk sari and Papas shirt is made of linen and my muffler is made of wool. But what is my frock made of? Its polyester, an artificial fibre. It doesnt come from a plant or an animal and is made in a laboratory, said Mamma. The siblings were very excited to learn that fabrics could be made in laboratories. They began looking through chapters on artificial fibres. They knew that some fibres were elastic. Like spandex, which track pants are made of. They read about how scientists developed high-performance fibres. These could resist heat, electricity and chemicals. Some new fibres are shock-absorbent; they are useful to the police and soldiers. Some dont catch fire easily; these are great for the fire brigade, read aloud Tanisha. Just then, Mamma said, Arnav, Tanisha, look what I have found in one of the library books you brought home. It was a book on high-tech fibres! She read aloud an interesting bit that said nanofibres made from carbon were called smart fibres. And smart fibres could sense temperature, pressure and radiation. Nanofibres...why are they called that? asked Arnav. Nanofibres are really thin fibres. When you divide one metre by a hundred crore, you get one nanometre. Nanofibres have a diameter of just a few nanometres, said Papa. 1 metre 1,00,00,00,000 1 nanometre As Arnav and Tanisha browsed through the pile of books, they also found out that cloth made from smart fibres is called intelligent material or e-textile. This is used in health wear. Such materials have tiny sensors in the fabric, which can pick up a patients breathing, heart rate and body temperature. This information can be sent to the doctor and the patient can stay at home. Now to return to your first question is it possible to become invisible? said Mamma. She had just read an article in a science magazine, which explained that scientists in a university had made a cloak that would make the wearer invisible. The fabric was made of fibres with a diameter of 80 nanometres. She pointed to an illustration and added, We can see any object say, a pair of red glasses or a blackboard because it reflects some of the light falling on it. But this cloak does not reflect light. Instead, the fabric bends the light a little so that it goes around it. So you cant see the cloak, or anyone under it. Can I get a shirt made with that material? asked Arnav, excited. Hed laugh so much at his friends expressions when they saw just his head and legs moving about, with nothing connecting them. Newspaper reports tell us that scientists and manufacturers are working on the idea. Such fabrics are being developed in some countries. But they are not available yet, said Mamma. Playing hide-and-seek wearing an invisibility cloak would be such fun... said Tanisha. Can this smart fabric be used by grown-ups for anything important? Yes, soldiers can wear this when theyre out fighting the enemy, Papa said. And when I need to work and you want me to play with you, I can play hide-and-seek by slipping under the invisibility cloak, he joked. At school, Arnav and Tanisha told their friends all about smart fabrics. I have an idea. Since Kelkar Sir hasnt come to class yet, why dont we go to the laboratory and do some exciting experiments, said Tanisha with a twinkle in her eye. Wait, whispered Arnav, what if he is actually hiding under an invisibility cloak to find out what mischief we might be up to? Smart fabric facts Some smart fibres are used to make cloth to clean lenses of spectacles, mirrors and jewellery. Clothes made from heat resistant fibres are used by people working in factories manufacturing explosives. Some fibres are hollow and can store perfumed liquid in them. These are used to make mattress and pillow covers. What would you do if you had an invisibility cloak? Lets see what Arnav and Tanisha plan to do! 1. When someone throws a plastic bottle, get under the cloak, pick up the bottle, and walk in front of the person. Imagine his horror when he sees the bottle moving in front of his eyes! 2. See Teachers glasses on the table? Cover it with the cloak. Teacher will never find his glasses. So no class! 3. Ring the recess bell early TAN-TAN-TAN!'}"

The soft metallic sound of a key turning in a lock made her happy. The key bunch Mummy kept tied to her saree was Manjus favourite toy. She loved to explore the mysterious depths of keyholes. Manju passed the village locksmith Ranjiths shop on her way to school every day. She loved to listen to the rasping of the tools as he made new keys. One day, Mummy needed to get a new key for her almirah. Manju went with her to Ranjiths shop. Ranjith picked up a flat piece of metal. What is this? Manju asked. This is a blank key, replied Ranjith. Then he held up Mummys key and said, See these pointy bits that look like mountains? And these curvy bits that look like valleys? Your almirah lock also has mountains and valleys inside it. The keys mountains and valleys fit that pattern. So when you turn the key, the lock opens! I am copying the mountains and valleys from the old key to the new one. So the new key will also open the almirah. Back home, Manju couldnt stop talking about the locksmith. She told Munira Aunty, who lived next door. She even told her cat, who stopped licking his face for half a minute and looked bored. When her cousin Riju came to visit that evening, she told her too. Riju was studying to be an engineer. Do you know, Riju didi, Manju said, if you want to make a new key for a lock, you have to copy the pattern of mountains and valleys from the old key to a blank key? Really? said Riju. Then its a very good thing that Mummy keeps the keys safe. Otherwise anyone could copy the key and steal our things! Thats true! This is the sort of thing that I am studying, said Riju. What, making keys? asked Manju. Something similar, replied Riju. We lock up things we want to keep safe, like the sarees in our almirah, right? Manju nodded. But what if the thing you want to keep safe is information? Like what, Riju didi? asked Manju. Like how much money you have in your bank account. Or your best friends secret. Or the notebook of recipes passed down from our grandmother to your mother. Oh yes, we need to keep those safe, agreed Manju. If we have to protect this information, we have to put it in a safe place and lock it! There are many safe places. Like my computer, where I keep my college notes, said Riju. She opened her laptop. To see my work, you have to type the password here! Whats a password? Manju wanted to know. A password is like a key. The almirahs lock opens only when the pattern on the key fits the pattern in the lock, like a jigsaw puzzle. My computer will only open if the password I type matches the password I have set. If you tell anyone the password, they can open it too! So you have to be very careful whom you give your password to. Hmmm When I get a computer, what should I set as my password? Manju wondered aloud. Some peoples passwords are really easy to guess their date of birth, their pets name, or the name of their street. A good password is difficult to guess. The longer it is, the harder it is to guess. It is better if it has letters and numbers. But a password should also be easy to remember. Just then, Mummy called Riju, who ran off to greet her aunt. TING! went Rijus mobile. What might that be? A new game? Riju had the best games! Manju often spent her evenings pestering her cousin to let her play. Today, she would play them by herself. Manju pressed a button on her cousins phone. The screen lit up. A keypad with numbers appeared. It needed a password! She pressed 1234. Incorrect password appeared on the screen. Then she tried 0000, but the phone did not unlock. She also tried Rijus birthday, 10-10-97. Hoi! That was Riju. Ive locked my phone with a password, she said. And I dont give it to nosey little girls. Manju stuck her tongue out. Now do you see why passwords are so important, Manju? Riju said. Theyre like keys to the things we want to keep private. Yes, didi, said Manju. I only wanted to play some games! And you only had to ask! Riju said, typing in her password. Let me show you a new game Guess the Password! Play with Manju This game gives you clues to passwords. See if you can crack them. Phone passwords 1. Manju is nine years younger than her cousin. If Manju chooses her birth year as her password, what would it be? 2. If Rijus password is her date of birth backwards, it would be... 3. Remember the first password Manju tried on Rijus phone? Whats that in reverse order? Answers: 1. 2006 2. 790101 3. 4321 Did you solve the clues? Remember, if you did, others can too. So here are some simple dos and donts: 1. Dont keep passwords that are too short (123, xyz, abcd are weak passwords). 2. Remember your password so that you do not have to write it down. If you write it down, someone might be able to find it. 3. Use both upper and lower cases (ComPUteR). 4. Dont use words that are easy to guess (The name of your school, dog or town). Passwords are used to unlock or open mobile phones, computers, safety vaults in banks, our accounts on websites, and many other things. Fingerprints and retina scans are also used as passwords. These are called bio-metric passwords. A password could also be a set pattern you trace on the screen. Like this:'}"

Nivi picks up the rolling pin and places it close to the gas knob. She arranges a row of tomatoes and potatoes behind it. The rasam-and-dal ladle is next. Nivi places it carefully on the edge of the shelf above the cooker. She then makes five of Nanis spoons stand up. These are the ones Nani uses to sip her watery khichdi. Finally, Nivi places her favourite plastic ball right above the spout of the pressure cooker. WHOOSH! The ball moves a little. WHOOSH! A little more. WHOOSH! The ball rolls down the third time.

This is what happens when you hit a coin with a striker on the carrom board and it, in turn, smashes into another, causing the second coin to land in a pocket! In a Rube Goldberg machine, a series of objects that carry out simple tasks work together to meet a common goal in a very complex way. Sure, its simpler to do things the easy way, but building a machine to do them is more fun. Try your hand at building your own Rube Goldberg machine to drop a teaspoon. Heres how. You will need: 1 thin book rolled up as a cylinder, 2 smooth long sticks for a slope, 2 thick books, 2 rulers, 1 marker, 1 eraser, 1 ball, 3 notebooks, 1 light plastic jar, a bundle of string, 1 teaspoon, 1 vessel, 1 smooth beam Roll the cylinder down the slope. The cylinder hits two books, placed standing up. They fall on the ruler, which is balanced on the marker. This, in turn, taps the ball. The ball hits the three notebooks. They land on the end of the second ruler, balanced on the eraser. The jar, placed on the other end of the ruler, is attached to the piece of string. The string is looped around the smooth beam above. The free end of the string is tied to the spoon. The jar rises when the third notebook falls on the ruler. The string falls down, dropping the spoon into the vessel.'}"

Tejas says, Look at this. This is the kiwi bird from New Zealand in the southern hemisphere. They are the only birds to have nose-holes, just like ours, at the end of their very long beaks. They dig and use their noses to find insects and fruit to eat. Thank you! says Durgesh. Also, my mother told me this story once. I think it was about a..a loris. Aah, yes, the Sri Lankan loris. It has beautiful silver hair on its tummy and eyes in the front, just like us, says Mirium. But we cannot see it now. It is active in the night. But we can always come back tomorrow! says Mahima.

When they r each the lights, Maisha takes a deep breath, holds Uchli tightly and . . . Maisha gasps. She feels like shes floating in a sky full of stars! There are tiny creatures glowing all around her. Wow, who are they? she whispers to Uchli. Theyre plankton. Maybe they can help light our way in the sea! Uchli says. Will you share your light with us? Maisha asks one of them. The moon is missing, and we need some light to find her. You will need more than just my light, the plankter says. Let me ask my friends if they can help too! Soon, Maisha and Uchli are joined by an army of little creatures, with their flickering lights. Now where can the moon be? Maisha wonders. I can help you, a deep, booming voice says, near Maisha's ear. She spins around. The eight arms of a firefly squid glimmer back at her. His body is covered in neon-blue lights. I saw the moon go this way just a little while ago. At first, Maisha is scared of the long tentacles. But she knows the firefly squids light can help them see better underwater. Lead the way, she says. The squid wraps a tentacle around Maisha's finger. Hold on tight! Then Maisha, Uchli, the glowing plankton and the firefly squid all swim down together. Down, down, down they go where to the water is very dark. But the plankton glow brighter, and the squid flashes his light. There is still no moon in sight. Then they meet an anglerfish, out on a hunt. She has sharp teeth, but Maisha is not scared any more. Hello, she says. Were looking for the moon. Have you seen her around? Yes, says the anglerfish. I saw her swimming with some moonfish a few hours ago. Follow me! Maisha, Uchli, the squid and the plankton follow the green lure of the anglerfish. The light from the glowing animals falls like a spotlight on the dark ocean floor. Suddenly, Maisha sees something bright under a rock. Its the moon! Help, squeaks the moon. Im stuck! The squid lifts the rock with his tentacles. Hurrah! everyone shouts, as the pale moon slips out. What happened? Uchli asks. I came here to meet my cousins, the moonfish, says the moon. I got lost on my way back when my light began to fade. And then I got stuck under this rock. Thank you for coming to find me. So this is where you are when youre not in the sky! Maisha says. The moon smiles and begins to float up towards the surface. Finally, she jumps into the sky. Uchli and Maisha wave goodbye to their new friends and swim back to the beach in the moonlight. The stars under the sea continue to shine deep into the night. MEET THE LIGHT-MAKERS Did you know that many animals, both above and under water, are able to make their own light? The tiny plankton that Maisha and Uchli meet glow to scare away the animals that might eat them. When they sense movement in the water, the plankton let out bright sparks as a warning. Sometimes, waves and boat traffic also trigger this light. While plankton animals have a chemical in them that helps them glow, the firefly squid has special organs called photophores that produce its light. Thousands of these light-producing photophores on the squids body flash to attract food, impress a mate or confuse predators. The lures of anglerfish get their light from the glowing bacteria that live inside them. Many plants and animals glow above the water too. Fireflies, some mushrooms, and even you emit a tiny amount of light every day!""}"

Its called a whale and it lives in the o cean. Tell me more! says Muznah. Well, there are many kinds of whales, but the size of this cloud makes me think of a blue whale. The blue whale is the biggest animal that has ever lived on Earth, much bigger than a dinosaur and much, much bigger than an elephant, says Dadu. Sooooooooooooooo big! says Muznah. Its so big that you would be able to sit inside its heart, explains Dadu. Your dogs nose is floating away, laughs Dadu. Maybe the nose doesnt like the dog anymore, Muznah giggles. Arre! Its floating towards the whale-cloud. What will the whale do with a nose? Fish need gills, not a nose to breathe underwater. That is true for a fish. But the blue whale is not a fish. It breathes air and so it has a nose, says Dadu. It must have the BIGGEST nose in the world! How does it breathe air, if it lives underwater? Whales are very special, explains Dadu. They breathe at the surface of the ocean. Ooooooo... so the whale swims in backstroke? Muznah asks. You have a vivid imagination, Muznah! laughs Dadu. The whale's nose is on its back! In fact, says Dadu, the sound of a whale breathing can be heard from far, far away. The whale takes a breath, goes under water, comes out of the water again, and goes PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF . Each breath creates a fountain on top of the whales nose. Muznah gazes at the whale-cloud. The whale with the nose on its back is moving towards us, Dadu! She lies on her back, her arms tucked in like fins. Waving her arms, Muznah shouts, Im a whale too... ... PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF , hello whale! Whale Watching! Here are some fun facts about whales. Whales are of many shapes and sizes, and live in all the oceans of the planet. They even breathe out fountains in different shapes and sizes! Scientists who study them can tell different whales apart by observing their breathing. Blue whales dont have teeth. Instead, they eat very small animals by swallowing a large amount of water and then filtering the animals in their baleen plates. They are mammals, which means they have babies, just like we do. Their babies are called calves. The calves swim with their mothers for years to learn all the wisdom needed to live happily in the oceans. Crossing the Line During summer, a mother whale and her calf move towards the polar regions, where there is more food. In winter, when the polar seas freezes, they move towards the tropics. Whales which live in the Southern hemisphere never cross over to the North. Those that live in the North never cross over to the South. Since the equator is not a real line in the oceans, only the whales know why they do not cross it! Even with all our technology, we still do not know how they do it.""}"

We want seeds that grow happily here, seeds that are best for our home soil and weather, says Bijay. What to do? What to do? says Suresh. We have a BIG problem. Nabita and Ketaki are part of a group of women farmers. They hold meetings. They meet the village head. They talk to farmers groups. What to do? What to do? everyone wonders. We have a BIG problem! After many days of talking, everyone looks happy. We know what to do, says Nabita. No problem is too BIG. We will start a bank! How will a bank help us? asks Bijay. Not a bank of money. A bank of seeds, says Ketaki. The farmers come together to start a seed bank. They deposit the few seeds they have at home. A seed bank works just like a bank! People go to a bank to save their money. At the seed bank, farmers save seeds! Old seeds Local seeds Organic seeds Cotton seeds Ladies fingers seeds Pumpkin seeds Paddy seeds Millet seeds Red gram seeds So many seeds to save. Sumati borrows one kilo of cotton seeds from the bank. Nabita carefully notes it down in a register. Krupa deposits one kilo of paddy seeds into the bank. Ketaki carefully stores the seeds in a pot. The seeds are sown and watered. The monsoon comes and goes. Its harvest time! The farmers get a good crop of cotton this year. They celebrate with their friends. Sumati gains more cotton seeds from the harvest. She repays her seed loan with interest, by depositing one-and-a-half kilos of cotton seeds into the bank. Ketaki carefully notes this down in the register. Nabita carefully stores the seeds in the pot. The seed bank now has lots and lots of seeds. Seeds for the next year. Seeds for the year after that. And the year after that! The cotton farmers no longer have a BIG problem . Because their seed bank is VERY BIG! The seeds are everywhere, in the bank and in the field! The Seed Bankers We need seeds to grow food and fibre for clothes. But seeds can cost a lot. Some seeds, called hybrid seeds, cannot be replanted after the harvest and have to be thrown away. Some seeds need chemicals to grow. These are genetically modified seeds. Then there are seeds that may be from another part of the world and not suited to the soil of your region. By saving local and organic seeds that do not need chemicals to grow, farmers dont need to buy seeds from the market. Just like a regular bank, they can deposit seeds. They can borrow them, and repay the loan with extra seeds! This story has been inspired by Maa Lankeshwari Seed Bank in Bhimdanga village in Odisha in India. A group called Chetna Organic helped farmers start a seed bank to save their cotton and other seeds. Many farmers in India and around the world have come together to form seed banks to save seeds. Often, women run seed banks. They are called Seed Bankers or Seed Guardians , because they protect seeds. There is also a bank for the worlds seeds in the cold and remote Arctic region. Its called the Svalbard Global Seed Vault . Here, you can find over 8,30,000 kinds of seeds from all over the world.'}"

Gogo finds Thembi sitting under the big tree, playing with her favourite doll. Gogo asks Thembi, Why are you sitting here, all alone? Oh, replies Thembi, the other children dont want to play with me. What about playing with your friend Sizani? asks Gogo. Sizani is mad at me, replies Thembi. She said that I just ignored her last week. Gogo, I really didnt see her. And what about playing with your brother? asks Gogo. Bongani doesnt like to play with me, sighs Thembi. He says that I miss every time he kicks the ball to me. But arent you lonely? asks Gogo. Oh no, replies Thembi. I love sitting here, listening to the tree sing its beautiful song. Listen, cant you hear it? Gogo listens and then looks up into the tree to see a beautiful Kingfisher, a Cuckoo, and a Robin, all singing their songs. Gogo remembers Thembis teacher once telling her that Thembi struggled to see things on the board. So, early the next morning, Gogo and Thembi walk to the local clinic. At the clinic, they meet Mr Ntuli. He asks Thembi to cover one eye with her hand and to look at the wall in front of her and tell him what she can see. Thembi looks carefully at the wall and says, I can see something, but I am not sure what it is. Mr Ntuli puts a metal frame on Thembis nose. Then, he slides a round glass into the frame and again asks Thembi, Now, what can you see? I can see everything! shouts Thembi. I can see the letter E and F and P, and even the little letters, P, Z and D. Thats perfect, says Mr Ntuli. All you need are glasses and you will see just fine. The nurse takes Thembi and Gogo to another room where there are many shelves filled with different kinds of spectacle frames. Thembi chooses a pair of bright red frames. A good choice, says Gogo. After one week, Thembi and Gogo return to Mr. Ntulis office. Thembi tries on her new glasses. Mr. Ntuli asks Thembi to look out the window and tell him what she sees. Oh, I see people and there is a small dog and there is a black bird on top of that house, says Thembi excitedly. Thembi, says Mr. Ntuli, I want you to promise me that you will wear your glasses every day. Oh, yes, replied Thembi. I promise. I love my new glasses. I love all the wonderful things I can see. As Gogo and Thembi walk home, Thembi sees Sizani on the other side of the road. Hi Sizani! Thembi shouts. She waves at Sizani. Sizani smiles and waves back. Just before Gogo and Thembi reach their house, they meet some of Thembis school friends. Oh Thembi, I love your new glasses, says one girl. They make you look really smart, comments one of the boys. All of a sudden, a ball comes rolling towards Thembi. It is Bongani. Thembi quickly kicks the ball back. Do you want to play? asks Bongani. Yes, Thembi replies, but first I have something very impotant to do. Thembi walks behind the house and sits under the large tree. As she looks up, she can see the Kingfisher, the Cuckoo, and the Robin. Thank you, tree. Thank you for always singing to me.'}"

I can tell you the make of every vehicle on the road. Arent cars amazing? B R R M M B R M M M and you can go anywhere in them. Bright yellow, her headlights blinked. She looked like a red fairy. Questions whirled in my mind. Where did she live? What was her name? I needed to know more about her. I cycled to the colony gate. I asked Guard Chacha if he knew anything about this sparkling little red car. He laughed and said, You like that car? That car and its owner have recently moved here. They live in house number 112. Thank you, I said and cycled home again. That evening, I went to house number 112, looking for my new neighbour. I spotted big cars but the little red car wasnt there. Then I saw a gate and behind the gate I saw Red Fairy. There was a cable attached to her left. Ooooo, Red Fairy moved with electricity, not petrol or diesel. She got herself charged to run around! The next day, I saw Red Fairy whizzing past. I ran behind her and raised my hand to stop her. She stopped! Sitting inside was a white-haired lady who smiled at me. She looked like my Nani. I gently patted Red Fairy and told Nani, I am a car expert but I have never seen a car like this. I really like her. I hope you will like me too, said Nani. Since Red Fairy and you live together, you must be very nice too, I said, and couldnt help but grin. You have given this little one a wonderful name Red Fairy, said Nani. And may I call you Red Fairys Nani? I asked. I told her about my love of cars and motorcycles and about my photo collection. Nani said, Red Fairy and I moved to the colony recently and do not know anyone here. Im glad you stopped us. My name is Meeto. I will ask Ma to introduce you to our neighbours, but first tell me more about Red Fairy. Nani offered to take me for a drive. I was so excited. I ran home and asked Ma for permission to go with Nani. Then I jumped into Red Fairys lap. Nani started her up and Red Fairy began to run. As we whizzed down the roads, I could hear no roar, only a purr. I asked Nani why the car was so quiet. She said, Red Fairy makes no noise and emits no smoke. Red Fairy zipped between cars small cars and big cars. People on the road stared and smiled at us. At a red light, an auto rickshaw driver was curious about Red Fairy and asked Nani a lot of questions about her. The light turned green and we drove on, ahead of everyone. No B R R M M B R M M M noise, yet zooming away. Soon we were at India Gate. Nani bought ice creams for us. Everything was grey. Nani said it was the smog that made things grey. I told her that my papa said that the air in Delhi was very polluted. The smoke that comes out of cars adds to this pollution, which is why my mother doesnt like my interest in cars. Nani listened as I shared stories with her. My sister Neeta and I often get ill and catch colds and coughs because of the pollution. But I do love cars. What do I do? I asked. Nani said she had been driving Red Fairy for eight years and they were good friends. Suddenly I felt that Red Fairy was whispering to me. Meeto, I do not pollute the air like other cars do. Also, I take very little space to move and park. I was now convinced that Red Fairy was magical. No smoke, no sound, no petrol and no diesel. And she was talking to me. Cars that use alternative energy can reduce air pollution. Who knows, you could become a scientist and invent cars that cause no pollution at all, said Nani. I decided that I would invent a new car and call it Vibgyor Fairy. Green Cars A green car is a car that is environmentally friendly. It consumes less or no petrol and emits little or no carbon dioxide. There are several kinds of green cars. Electric car: This runs on an electric motor and stores energy in large rechargeable batteries. Hybrid car: This has two motors, one electric and one internal combustion. It uses less petrol than regular cars and causes less pollution. Hydrogen car: This uses hydrogen for fuel instead of petrol. Instead of smoke, it produces water vapour which is great for the environment. Solar car: This uses solar energy for power. Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity to run the car. There are no exhaust fumes or emissions.'}"

Baba sets off to chase the aroma of tea. Can we have two cups of tea, please? asks Baba. And a small cup for Meera, please, says Maa. Right away! says the cha wallah dada. SssskkkkHe lights the stove with a match and places a pan of water on the fire. The water gets hotter and hotter. The tiny bubbles get bigger and bigger. The water starts boiling. Dada pours some milk into the pan with the boiling water. Maa, see how the milk shares its colour with the water, says Meera. Now, see what happens when the tea leaves are added, says Maa. Meera patiently waits for two minutes and then says in surprise, Ooh, it is changing colour again. Is the tea ready now, Dada? Meera asks. Almost ready, he says. Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh! He pours three cups of tea through a strainer, leaving behind little piles of sticky leaves. Finally, he adds sugar. At home, this is Meeras job when Maa and Baba make tea. She loves the sound of the spoon tinkling against the cups. Meera stares into the cups asthe sugar disappears. Now it is ready! says Meera. Watch Dada make cha Can you arrange these processes in the correct order to make a cup of hot tea? Dissolution: Dada adds sugar to the tea, it mixes and disappears into the tea, making it sweet. This is when a solid breaks down, and becomes part of the liquid. Filtration: Dada pours the tea through the strainer into the cup, keeping the leaves behind. This is when bits of solid inside a liquid are removed when the liquid passes through a filter. Diffusion: The smell of tea moves from Dadas shop to Babas nose through the air around them. This is when one substance mixes into another evenly. These substances move from a place that has more of them to a place that has less of them. Convection: While making tea, the hot fluid at the bottom of the pan rises to the top because it is lighter. The cooler fluid on top, sinks to the bottom and takes its place. This cycle continues and eventually heats the liquid uniformly. This is how heat flows within fluids. Conduction: Dada puts the pan on the stove, l ights it up, and the pan heats up.

Oh no, wails Shyam. The seams of his favourite shirt have come apart. I cant wear this shirt anymore, Thatha! Of course you can, silly, his grandfather says. We can repair it! Thatha takes a needle and a spool of blue thread. He shows Shyam how to stitch the seams together. Shyams friend Shrisha has come home. Lets go cycling, she says. In a minute, says Shyam. Let me iron my shirt first. He switches on the iron box. But the light doesnt glow, and the iron remains cold. Ufff! Ill just wear the crumpled shirt, grumbles Shyam. I was at the Repair Mela last week, says Shrisha. George Uncle, who teaches chemistry in my brothers college, was repairing an iron box. I watched what he was doing very closely. Lets try to set it right! Do you have a screwdriver? Shyam hunts in the cupboard and gets a screwdriver. Shrisha unscrews the back of the iron. See this wire? When you switch on the power, electric current passes through it and heats up the iron plate. This process is called conduction, says Shrisha. And this small thing is the thermostat. It makes sure that the iron doesnt get too hot. If the heat goes way up, it just cuts off the power. The red light goes out. When the iron cools down, the current flows again and the light comes on. Other heating devices must work the same way, right? Geysers, kettles, ovens? But Shrisha is not listening. Shes peering into the iron. Whats wrong? asks Shyam. I dont think I can repair it. Oh no! Appa and Amma will scold us when they see what we have done to the iron box! Well take it to the Repair Mela! Theyll help us. Before Shyam's parents can ask them about the iron box, he and Shrisha take it and sneak out on their cycles to the Repair Mela. Aunty, can you help us repair this iron box? Shrisha asks Anupama Aunty. Whats wrong with it? It wont switch on! says Shrisha. Anupama Aunty takes out a little box with wires and knobs. This is a multimeter, she says. It checks if all parts of the iron are allowing electric current to flow. Lets start with the plug. Next, she tests all the other parts, until she comes to a small wire. See this wire next to the plug? Its broken, even though it doesnt look damaged theres your problem! She cuts out the old wire and plug, and fixes a new wire and plug to the iron box. Lets test it. She switches it on, and the light glows. After helping out at the Mela and observing repairs for a while, they decide to head home. Oh no, the rear tyre has a puncture. Lets take it to Manigandan Anna! says Shrisha. Puncture? No problem, says Manigandan Anna, who has a small cycle repair shop in the neighbourhood. He has been invited to the Repair Mela. He turns the cycle upside down. He takes a pair of tyre levers and pries the tyre away from the metal rim. Soon the inner tube is out. Can you see a hole anywhere? Anna asks the children. They cant. Then how do you tell where the puncture is? he asks. The children look at him cluelessly. He immerses the tube, part by part, in a tub half-filled with water. At one point, they see small bubbles rising. See? Thats where the hole is! He cuts a small piece of rubber from an old tube. After rubbing the surface of the tube around the hole with sandpaper, he applies a rubber adhesive to the tube and the piece of rubber. Come, seal this, he says. Shyam puts the piece of rubber on the hole and presses it down. If not for professionals who fix cycles, umbrellas, footwear and other things, we would have mountains of waste all over! says Shyam. The tyre is fixed, the iron is fixed and Shrisha and Shyam ride back home. It is a day well spent! Dont throw it. Fix it There is an urgent need to decrease the amount of non-biodegradable waste that humans generate. Repair encourages a more efficient use of resources than the take, make and waste culture that is replacing our traditional way of make, preserve and reuse. Raw materials used in products often need a lot of energy to be mined and processed to make them usable by manufacturers. The process of repair helps conserve these resources and extends the life of the product. Only when something cannot be repaired should you think of recycling it. The tradition of recycling In India, we have a strong tradition of recycling, whether it is organic waste like food or inorganic waste like clothes. While their numbers have reduced greatly, we still find kabadiwalas who collect old newspaper and recyclable household metal and plastic waste, and street peddlers who take in your old clothes in return for new steel utensils. Repair Caf This story is inspired by Repair Caf Bengaluru that conducts free workshops where people from different generations come together and keep alive the culture of repairing things. At a Repair Caf, youll find tools and materials to help you make any repairs you need. Repair enthusiasts and professionals like cobblers, umbrella repairers, alteration tailors and watch repairers work with visitors at these workshops. After any natural calamity, repair professionals are in high demand. In less than three years, Repair Caf Bengaluru has prevented over 2,000 kg of items from going to the waste heap. Repair Cafs around the world jointly saved 3,00,000 objects from the waste mountain in 2017. Have you used any of these tools? If not, get someone to teach you to use them. This is a very useful skill to have.""}"

Every day Chanda, Tinku and Motu have a new plan up their sleeves. Some days they trek to the nearby hill. On other days, they play hide and-seek in the caves behind the house. They plan to go stargazing tonight. But right now, they are off to Chandas Ma and Babas laboratory. Chandas parents are agricultural scientists. Sharma Kaka, who is also a scientist at the laboratory, lets them in. Motu, please be as quiet as a mouse, says Chanda. Tinku looks around huge books, rice saplings, laboratory equipment. Chanda spots a magnifying glass and hands it to Tinku. He peers into it and his eyes become BIG. Ooooh, how does Motus nose look five times its actual size? asks Tinku. A magnifying glass has a powerful lens that makes small objects look bigger, and helps us see them clearly, says Chanda. Does that mean the magnifying glass can help me look at all kinds of small things? Like ants and sugar and even those germs Ma says live in my teeth, says Tinku. You can definitely see ants and sugar and all the jeera golis you drop while eating them. But to see germs, you need an even more powerful instrument called a microscope, says Chanda. Micro means very small. Does it make small things look very big? asks Tinku. Yes, Ma works on the microscope all the time. Come, let me show you. Tinku is fascinated with how the microscope looks. The magnifying glass has just one lens; the microscope uses a combination of lenses to make things look really large. We can see what our hair is made of, what leaves are made of and even what makes up our blood! When we give our blood sample for testing at the laboratory, the pathologist looks through the microscope and tells us which bacteria or virus is making us sick,says Chanda. Didi, when I want something small to look bigger, I can use a magnifying glass. When I want something even smaller to look bigger, I can use a microscope, says Tinku. But what can I use when I want to see something that is far away and looks tiny? You can use a pair of binoculars or you can use a telescope,says Chanda. Doesnt Salim Mamu use binoculars when he goes to watch birds? asks Tinku. Yes, he uses binoculars. He doesnt want to disturb the birds by going too close to them! I have Babas old pair of binoculars, lets see what it can do. All I see is blue! says Tinku. Chanda laughs. ""You are looking at the sky! Little by little, bring your hands down. Sloooowly. I can see a bird pecking at something! But if I move my hand even a little, it goes away. That is because its lenses are very powerful. Even a slight movement of your hands will completely change the view from your binoculars, says Chanda. That night, Chanda and Tinku return to the laboratory to go stargazing. The scientists have arranged for a telescope from the nearby planetarium. I will show it to you, she tells Tinku. Standing on the terrace, his eyes fixed to the telescope, Tinku says, Saturn looks just like the drawings in our school books. We cant see it like this without a powerful telescope. Some telescopes are as large as huge houses and are powerful enough to show us galaxies far away, says Chanda. Tinku gazes at the star-burst sky and asks, Didi, do you think that people from other planets are looking at us through their telescopes too? Chanda grabs the telescope and searches for aliens. What Do You See? Magnifying glasses and microscopes help us see small things clearly. Binoculars and telescopes help us see faraway objects better. All have one or more lenses. A lens is a piece of glass or some other see-through material that is curved on one or both sides. As light moves in a straight line, lenses help to bend it in such a way that when it reaches the eye, the object seen through the lens can look bigger or smaller than it really is.'}"

Mayas family owns a rocket ship. But she is not allowed to use it. Not without a grown-up. Ava really wants to see Pluto. She is Mayas best friend and loves everything about space and astronomy. She wants Maya to fly her to Pluto. Please, says Ava. Please, please. My parents will be angry, Maya protests. Theyre out for the weekend, and its not that far to Pluto. Well be back before your parents return, promises Ava. Maya reluctantly agrees. Her brother Reyhaan tags along. The three friends soar off from Earth on a hot summer night. Ava bounces with excitement. Ava starts reeling off facts about the Solar System. Do you know that one day the sun will die? asks Ava. You say the strangest things, Ava. How can the sun die? asks Reyhaan. The sun gets its energy by burning hydrogen to produce helium. Slowly, all its hydrogen will get used up. Probably in five billion years, says Ava. Ava tells Reyhaan that when a star the size of the sun dies, it becomes a white dwarf. When a star bigger than the sun dies, it becomes a black hole. Suddenly, there is a loud beeping. ALERT! ALERT! HEAVY OBJECT PULLING SHIP OFF COURSE, says the computer. The friends stare at the screen. But I cant see anything, says Reyhaan. No, look, says Maya. The stars in Orions Belt are no longer in a straight line. Ava gulps. I...I...I think we are near a black hole. The gravitational field of the black hole is bending the light of the stars near it, like a lens bends light that passes through it. CONFIRMATION. BLACK HOLE TWICE AS HEAVY AS THE SUN. MOVING AT THE SPEED OF THE SHIP. BLACK HOLE EVENT HORIZON 5 KILOMETRES AWAY. BLACK HOLE? Maya and Reyhaan ask together. W...w...we need to move away NOW, Ava stammers. If we reach the black hole, we will be sucked in forever! Why? demands Reyhaan. First lets get away! Ava says, almost in tears. Maya is shaking with fear. She yells commands at the computer. Full power, double power. Accelerate away from the black hole. Put everything you have! FIRING EMERGENCY BOOSTERS. But the pull is too strong. APPROACHING BLACK HOLE. 4 KILOMETRES TO EVENT HORIZON. 3 KILOMETRES. 2 KILOMETRES. Were being pulled towards it, Maya says. Suddenly, the computer announces, HOLDING AT 1 KILOMETRE. 500 METRES AWAY FROM EVENT HORIZON. MAXIMUM POWER. HOLDING. HOLDING. HOLDING. HOLDING... The rocket remains motionless. A silent tug-of-war is taking place. On one side is the terrible gravitational pull of the black hole. On the other side is the power of the super new-generation rocket. The computer announces, PULLING AWAY. 1 KILOMETRE, 1.5 KILOMETRES, 2 KILOMETRES AWAY FROM EVENT HORIZON. MOVING AWAY FROM BLACK HOLE. The three friends, who have been clinging to each other all this while, let go and drop to their seats. All they want is to return home. To Earth. Maya makes sure the spaceship is on the right course and then asks, Ava, what happened just now? What exactly is a black hole? Ava takes a deep breath and explains that when a star larger than the sun dies, it collapses into itself. It squeezes into nothing and becomes like a hole in space. Even time behaves funnily inside and near a black hole. It runs at a different rate near the black hole from anywhere else, she says. What happens when something like a rocket ship falls into a black hole? asks Reyhaan. Well, it is sucked into the centre of the black hole and is torn into nothing, Ava says. Reyhaan squeals, Seriously? He and Maya realise that they have had a narrow escape. Can nothing come out of a black hole? Maya asks. Ava shakes her head. Not even light comes out of a black hole. The event horizon of the black hole is the point of no return. Anything that falls into the event horizon is lost forever to the outside world. Reyhaan shudders but Maya has more questions. She wants to know how many black holes there are in the universe. Nobody is really sure, says Ava, But scientists guess that there is, perhaps, one black hole for every thousand stars in the universe. If this is right, then there are a billion billion black holes in total. Ava explains that some black holes have a mass of about that of the sun. But other black holes are much bigger. There is a huge one right in the middle of our galaxy, with a mass of more than a million suns, she says. Reyhaan and Maya look nervous. Ava assures them that it is far, far away. About 30 million billion kilometres away. The rocket zooms towards Earth. I want to get home now, says Reyhaan. I think we are very close, Maya says. To everyones relief, the computer announces, LANDING. WELCOME BACK TO EARTH. The three of them rush out of the ship into Maya and Reyhaans backyard. They are stunned by the chilly winds that hit their faces. Didnt we leave when it was super hot? And I thought we were away from home for just a few hours, says Maya. Maya...Reyhaan...Its winter... says Ava. Maya finishes Avas thought, Time runs at a different rate near the black hole from anywhere else. In the time that they had spent fighting the black hole, six months had gone by on Earth. Maya and Reyhaans parents had come back from their weekend trip months ago. The three friends are in big trouble! What is a Black Hole? The Indian scientist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar first understood that big stars collapse into black holes. This discovery won him the Nobel Prize. Black holes are the densest objects in the universe. No object of the same mass can occupy less space than a black hole. Throwing things into a black hole makes it bigger, but it is almost impossible to make black holes smaller. Scientists believe that black holes less than 3 km in radius are not formed from collapsing stars. But tiny black holes may have been produced during the early universe and may have stuck around. Event Horizon: Its the boundary of the region of no return. While objects outside the event horizon can escape from the black hole, objects that cross it never come out again. Mass: Roughly, its the weight of an object. More precisely, a measure of how difficult it is to accelerate (to move) an object. All the weird properties of black holes illustrated in this story are accurate. However, even with very advanced technology, our story is a fantasy. A rocket would have to travel at about a quarter of the speed of light (75,000 kms) to make it to Pluto and back in a day. Passengers accelerating to this speed over a couple of hours would experience a force about a thousand times their weight. They would be subject to even greater forces while hovering very near a black hole. Human bodies cannot withstand these forces. Also, for dramatic effect, we have greatly exaggerated the difference in time passed on Earth.'}"

That is because the meaning of the word is stored in her brain. When Siphar presses Enter on the computer, the computer understands. That is because the meaning of the word is stored in its brain. The instruction Enter is stored in the brain of the computer in Binary. Binary is the language we use to communicate with computers. If you saw words or instructions in Binary, you would be confused. That is because Binary uses only a series of 1s and 0s. Each 1 and each 0 is important. Each 1 and each 0 gives the computer an important message. The computer is made up of millions of circuits which allow electricity to pass. Or not. When electricity passes, it is ON and is written as 1. When it doesnt pass, it is OFF and is written as 0. That is why the language is called Binary. It comes from bini, which is Latin for two together. In this language, there are only two letters. The letters are called bits. Eight bits make a byte. Using just 1 and 0, you can communicate many things to the computer. The letter A is stored as the byte 01000001. The letter B is stored as the byte 01000010. The word Hello is stored as 01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111. Enter, too, is stored as a string of 1s and 0s . Enter is an instruction. If this instruction is given to you, you may choose to enter or not to enter. If this instruction is given to the computer, it will follow the instruction. Even a picture in a computer is stored as 1s and 0s. A picture is made of tiny points of colour called pixels. Each pixel corresponds to a string of 1s and 0s. They tell the computer how bright the green is or how dark the blue is for an individual pixel. Music too is stored in Binary. Each note of each instrument stands for a number called a frequency. This is translated into 1s and 0s . In Binary, if it is NOT 1, it IS 0. If it is NOT 0, it IS 1. Binary is for machines. You are NOT a machine. So if you are NOT a one at something, it doesnt mean you are a zero. If you are NOT good at something, it doesnt mean you are bad at that thing. As human beings, we are lucky. We can choose to be any value in between. The 3,000-year-old Chinese book I Ching or Book of Changes uses diagrams based entirely on two symbols. Some 2,500 years later, this book inspired the German mathematician and philosopher Leibniz to invent the new binary arithmetic. The Indian mathematician Pingala also used two symbols, sometime in the 2nd century BCE, in Chandahsastra . He used laghu (light) and guru (heavy) for long and short syllables in poetry.'}"

Suddenly she turned to me and asked the meaning of my name. Himani means snow, I said. Why does she ask so many questions? April 3 What a fun day it was! We played a game. One of us needed to think of a problem that we might have faced and state it in the form of a question. Then another classmate had to ask a question related to it. It was almost like a chain story. We had so many questions! How can we get clean drinking water in school? Why do we need clean water? Where will the water come from? Why cant we have a pipe straight from the melting glaciers? Why do you ask such questions? Why dont we concentrate on our water problem? Why cant we have a water filter? Where will we get a water filter from? Why cant we make it? Who knows how to make one? SOLVE ANY PROBLEM, STEP BY STEP Identify the problem. Find out everything you can about the problem. Discuss. Decide on the most suitable idea. Try it out. If you succeed, very good! If not, try another idea. April 4 We were surfing the Internet when I found this chart: Could we really solve a problem using this method? April 5 At school, we made a list of our problems. How many problems do we have? BIG PROBLEMS Neighbours who get violent after drinking No hospital or clinic near by Leeches in our socks during the rains. No direct water at home or school Landslides Slippery roads to school during the monsoon PROBLEMS WE CAN SOLVE Plastic bottles everywhere Unclean drinking water Heavy school bag Unlit paths at night April 6 Worked with Ija and Baujyu in the cauliflower patch. Then ran to school for problem-solving day! We went out in pairs to the library, and to talk to our teachers and to each other. Then we came back to class. 1. Identify : The problem is unfiltered drinking water at school. Students keep falling sick because of this. 2. Find out : Why is getting clean water a problem here? Many streams around Kumaon are supposed to have pure water. There are no streams near our school. 3. Discuss : We found out that some people use cloth. This only filters bigger sediments, not harmful bacteria. Manorama said they have a small water filter at home. Moringa seeds in water pots help purify water, said a teacher. 4. Decide : Would a water purifier help us? Pebbles Moringa Seeds Coarse Sand Charcoal Fine Sand Cloth Try it out! We all drew water filters! We decided we needed one that could be attached to the nozzle of our water drum. Santosh bhai and Ashish bhai, our seniors, helped us make a water filter based on our drawings. They have taken a few days off from college to make a water catchment system in our school. The filtered water tasted so fresh and clean! April 11 In the last three days, weve done a lot of art. We have applied the problem-solving method to come up with more ideas. Cycle Plough Does not require cattle or a tractor to pull it. Good for narrow step farms. Bottle Torch Torch made with recycled parts. Fitted inside a discarded plastic bottle, so that dampness does not spoil it. Dampness spoils battery-operated torches very quickly in this region. Mini-irrigator Drip irrigation for crops like grapes that need soil to stay hydrated. Made with recycled water bottles, attached to plants like IV tubes in hospitals. April 13 Now that the workshop is over, were all busy with harvesting and packing apricots, pears, apples and rhododendron flowers. Ija and Baujyu are so nimble and good at picking fruits! Not me. Yesterday, I slipped and twisted my ankle while picking fruit. No fracture, thank God! I wish I had a gadget that could pick fruits for me! Maybe we could train Golu and the other goats to pick fruits, ha, ha. Seriously, how wonderful it would be to have an efficient, safe, eco-friendly apple-picking machine! Satkhol Tales This story was inspired by the work of The Walking School Bus during their Himalayan Expeditions in 2018. TWSB works towards providing safe transport, nutrition, and innovative literacy programmes. Their contest Search for Jugaad sought inventive and scalable ideas that could enable people to find local solutions to challenges of education specific to their community. The images in this story were drawn by Divya, Manasa, Pooja, Deepanshu J, Ritesh, Lakshit, Ujwal, Deepanshu N and Pushpastudents of class 3-8 of Himalayan Public School, Uttarakhand. Over 80 students were part of the art classes conducted by TWSB.'}"

Samir said excitedly. Samir had been waiting all day for his Chachi to arrive. She was an expert in water conservation. She had promised Samir that she would help him with his school project. Samir ran down the steps and hugged his Chachi! I am glad to see you too, Samir, Mina Chachi smiled. Chachi, my project is due next week! I have to list down different ways by which we can save water. I only have two so far. Samir said. Not bad! What are the two ways you have thought of? Mina Chachi asked. I asked Nani and Nana what they do. Nani said that they water their plants with the water they use to wash their vegetables. I thought that it was a great idea. Samir said. That is an excellent idea, Mina Chachi agreed. What is the second way you have come up with? Mina Chachi asked. UmmI thought if I put a bucket on the terrace every time it rained, I could collect water. Then I could use the bucket of water in the toilet, instead of flushing,"" Samir explained. Wow! You are trying to set up your own rainwater harvesting system, by collecting rainwater. Thats clever of you,"" Mina Chachi said. A few months back I helped the people of an apartment complex reduce their water usage. I think it would be useful if you spoke to the residents, Mina Chachi said. That sounds interesting! I will take my notebook so that I can write down everything! Samir said excitedly. Mina Chachi and Samir arrived at the apartment complex. I cant wait to meet all the people! Samir said excitedly. Have fun! I will wait for you in the car park, Mina Chachi said. Samir rang the bell. A cheerful aunty greeted them at the door. Hello Tara Aunty! I am Samir. Yes, yes, Mina said that you would be coming! How can we help you Samir? Tara aunty invited him in. I wanted to know what you do to save water, Samir asked. Well Samir, both Sahil and I use just one bucket to have a bath. It uses a lot less water than a shower, Tara aunty explained. I am also very careful about any leaks in the house. I repair a broken pipe without wasting any time. I also save water by using the rinsed water to clean the house. Wow! You and Sahil uncle are doing so much to save water. Thank you for showing me around, Samir said as he said goodbye. Tara aunty was so nice. I wonder what everyone else will have to say, Samir thought. I have already made a lot of notes based on what she said. Notebook in hand, Samir went from house to house! ""I use only a cup of water to brush my teeth. A running tap uses too much water,"" Adi explained. ""My father and mother do that too."" I use a twin flush system. I have a small flush that uses very little water and another big one that uses more water. I use the flush according to how much I need. It has helped me save a lot of water, Nikhil Uncle said. We scrape all the food wastes from the plates before washing anything. We also wash all the dishes in a sink full of water, instead of running the tap. We also wash the vegetables in a bowl full of water. Rao uncle said. I collect all that water and use it for the plants, Rao aunty said. My Nana and Nani do that too! Samir said, excitedly. I dont use a hose pipe to wash my car and bike, Mala aunty said. I use a bucket of water instead. In fact, I try and use rainwater for most of my washing. Samir said goodbye to all the residents and went home. I think I have enough to finish my school project, Mina Chachi! Thank you so much, said Samir. I am always happy to help my favourite nephew! Mina Chachi smiled. I am going to try and use everything I learnt today to save water in our house, Samir said. I also realised that we use the least amount of water for drinking and cooking. Is that correct? You are right, Samir, Mina Chachi said. Where does all the water go then?"" Samir asked. Most of our water gets used in flushing, washing utensils, washing clothes, gardening and bathing, Mina Chachi replied. Wow! I will put it in my school project. Samir said, writing everything. You really helped the residents reduce their water usage, Mina Chachi. I am beginning to understand how you did it. Do you know why we need to save water? Mina Chachi asked. Because it is impossible to live without water, Samir replied. That is true, but also because 1.3 billion people in India dont have clean water like you and me! 1.3 billion! How much is that? It sounds like a big number, said Samir. It is a big number. It is a number made out of 13 digits! Mina Chachi said. There are some people who travel for four hours just to fill two buckets of water! When we save water, we help all those people! That sounds terrible, Samir said. I thought we found water everywhere! That is why it is so important that we save water, Mina Chachi said. If you make an effort and tell enough people around you to save water, you will be helping the environment, Mina Chachi said. I will do my best, Mina Chachi! Samir replied. I promise! Bathing 15 Washing Clothes 19 Cooking 3 Drinking 2 Gardening 17 Washing Utensils 15 Flushing 29 If you used only a bucket of water during the day then this is where all the water would get used I am Nira. I walk for four hours everyday so that my children have some water to drink. This is the only water we get during the day. I am Bushy, the Egret. The water that comes from your homes into this lake is making it very difficult for me to breathe! I am Ghuru, the Gharial. The water in the Yamuna is becoming dirtier by the day. If you help save this water, you will also save my home! Here are some people and animals who you would be helping when you save water I am Ram. I havent gone to school for three weeks because my stomach has been upset. The water we drink is very dirty. Wash vegetables under running water Wash his fathers care with a hose pipe Use a mug of water to brush his teeth What are the activities that Samir should do to save water and what shouldnt he do. Draw all the activities from the list below that save water on a piece of paper and pin it up in your room so you can remember. Collect rainwater to use around the house Have a bath with a bucket Run the washing machine when it is only half full Use the shower to have a bath Conserving water is one of the ways of being a responsible and active citizen. There are many other ways you can be an active citizen in your community. Below is a pledge you can take to show your commitment to becoming an active citizen I ..................................... take the Active Citizen Pledge. I am a citizen of India. I care about my responsibilities and rights. I care about my friends, my family, and my community. I respect the rules of my country and my city. I pledge to: Take care of my school, parks, playgrounds and other public spaces. Treat everyone with respect. Save water and electricity at home and school and wherever I go. Follow road safety and traffic rules. Segregate waste, not litter and always throw garbage in dustbins. Use public transport. Not throw plastic and other items in lakes and rivers. Vote in elections once 18 years of age. About Janaagraha J anaagraha (www.janaagraha.org) was founded by Swati Ramanathan and Ramesh Ramanathan in December 2001. It is registered under the Indian Trusts Act, 1882. Janaagrahas mission is to transform quality of life in Indias cities and towns and it defines quality of life as comprising quality of infrastructure and services and quality of citizenship. We work with citizens to catalyze active citizenship in city neighbourhoods and with governments to institute reforms to city governance (what we call city-systems). Civic Learning, Civic Participation and Advocacy and Reforms are Janaagrahas three major strands of work to accomplish its mission. Quality of Citizenship is an integral component of Quality of Life and therefore, Janaagrahas Civic Learning Program is aimed at catalyzing Active Citizenship in our cites. We firmly believe that systematic Civic Learning is a prerequisite for large-scale civic participation in our cities, whereby citizens will take ownership of their neighborhoods and cities and work constructively with each other and their governments to solve civic problems. Good citizenship is about what citizens do, rather than who they are. As citizens, we can make our cities a better place to live in and improve our quality of life. In this process we become responsible, engaged and active citizens.'}"

Whats that smell? cries Tara. A MONSTER! yells Madhav. It is hot, dark and stinky. The whole house smells! Where is the smell coming from? Ma checks the bedroom. Madhav checks the bathroom. Tara checks the dining room. Pa checks the kitchen. Its coming from there, says Pa, pointing at the fridge. A stinky fridge monster? gasps Tara. Scared, says Madhav, hugging Ma. Lets open the fridge and see whats inside, says Ma. Ma opens the fridge. Everyone covers their noses and mouths. Hmm, its warm inside and the light is off, says Ma, sticking her arm into the fridge. What happened? asks Tara. ""The fridge stopped working some time ago,"" Pa explains. ""Without the cold air, everything spoiled, says Ma, glumly. Has the milk gone bad? asks Tara. Yes, can you smell how sour it is? asks Ma. Milk needs to be kept cold to stay fresh, says Pa. Has the bread gone bad? asks Tara. Yes, do you see that green stuff? Thats mould, says Pa, It grows on the bread. Fuzzy, says Madhav, curiously. Dont touch it, says Pa. Youll fall sick if you eat it. Have the vegetables gone bad too? asks Tara, sadly. Yes, theyre rotten, says Ma. We cant eat them. Madhav picks up an egg and drops it. Madhav, now it smells even worse! shouts Tara. Oh no! These have gone bad too, says Pa. Tara is sure she can never eat eggs again. Yuck, yuck, yuck! cries Madhav, running away while Pa cleans up the mess. They put all the rotten food into garbage bags and clear the fridge. Why do things go bad? asks Tara. Everything goes bad over time. The cold air of the fridge keeps food fresh for longer. When its warm, food goes bad faster, says Ma. Does all food spoil?asks Tara Not this rice, says Ma, Or these potatoes, at least for a while. And not this pickle, says Pa. And not this ghee, says Ma. ""We can eat ghee rice and potatoes!"" says Tara, happily. Invisible Monsters Tara and Madhav thought there was an invisible monster in their house. While there was no monster to be found, they were right about there being something invisible! When food goes bad meaning it cannot be eaten by human beings its because something invisible has begun to eat the food. These invisible beings are called microbes. Microbes arent totally invisible: theyre just very, very, very tiny (tinier than the tiniest insect youve ever seen). You need a machine called a microscope to be able to see them. They look something like this. When Food Goes Bad Some foods spoil quicker than others and some foods spoil very slowly. Wet foods, like many fruits and vegetables, spoil faster. Dry foods, like uncooked dal and rice, spoil slower. Eggs, meat and cheese spoil fast. Preserved foods, like pickles and ghee, spoil very slowly. Packaged foods, like biscuits and sweets, spoil the slowest.'}"

Take another basket and add ten eggs to this too. Keep doing this till you have collected the last egg. In the end, you will have many baskets with ten eggs each. Raghu made a face at Kavya.

Gundappan Sir, the maths teacher, knew exactly where the bomb had exploded. T. Sundari! Please leave the classroom, he said. The class went quiet and everyone looked at T. Sundari, who sat on the fifth bench. But sir! Please sir! I tried to control my laughter but it burst out of me! Everyone in 4 B burst out laughing too. T. Sundari laughed a lot. She laughed for nearly everything. For example, last week, a classmate told T. Sundari this joke: Q: Why does Maths Sir always look sad? A: Because he has to solve so many problems. T. Sundari had narrowed her eyes and giggled. No wonder everyone laughed when they saw Gundappan Sir now. Every joke evoked a different reaction from T. Sundari. Sometimes a guffaw AH A HA HAHA Sometimes a giggle Pe he heh eh hee Sometimes a polite laugh Tra la la ha ha Sometimes a Ghatotkacha laugh MUHAHAHAHAHA In the Indian epic, Mahabharata, Ghatotkacha is a huge and powerful rakshasa with a loud and rumbling laugh. Sometimes, when T. Sundari tried really hard to suppress her laughter, it would burst out of her like a bomb. mmmmmm prrrrffttrrrrr ahhaahaha HAHAHAHAHA H AAHAHAHA T. Sundari was worried. Was there something wrong with her? Why couldnt she stop laughing? She needed to do something. Stuffing a hanky in her mouth didnt help. It just popped out of her mouth when she laughed. T. Sundari made a list of things she found funny: 1. Farts 2. Toilet jokes 3. The word bonda 4. People slipping on banana peels 5. Tickling I will make sure I never laugh at these again, decided T. Sundari. Poot poot potrrrrrrr Next day, during library, P. Manigantan moved behind a bookcase and let out a delicate sound right next to T. Sundari. T. Sundari, who knew a fart when she heard one, erupted in laughter, forgetting all about her list! This was not going to work. It was time for plan B. Skandu Anna, T. Sundaris older brother and a scientist, was plan B. Maybe he could invent a machine that could stop her from laughing? When T. Sundari told him what was bothering her, Skandu Anna, who was usually the serious sort, burst out laughing. T. Sundari wondered if this was a family problem. Did they all have the same laughing disease? No, Skandu Anna explained. T. Sundari, its very normal for human beings to laugh when they find something funny. Some people laugh more than others and that is fine. Really? said T. Sundari, who had always been told she laughed too much. Yes, in fact, laughter is good for health, Skandu Anna reassured her. It releases chemicals that bring us joy. Did you know even early humans laughed? Anna asked her. T. Sundari imagined a man with a large beard and big club giggling like her in drawing class. Yes, said Anna, Human ancestors were laughing long before they had language. It was their way of telling each other that everything was okay. Today, we laugh to show others that we like them or to express our happiness. Other animal species can laugh too, T. Sundari. Like chimpanzees, bonobos, rats, dolphins and even dogs! Anna told her. The thought of her pet dog Muthu laughing set T. Sundari off again. When the laughter finally subsided, Anna said, Do you know you just exercised, T. Sundari? How, Anna? We were talking the whole time. Whenever you smile even a little, the muscles of your face get to work. So each time you giggle or laugh, its a complete workout for your face, Anna told her. Ooh, said T. Sundari, will my cheeks have biceps then? Anna smiled, Not biceps, no. Those are in your arms. But whenever you laugh, the zygomaticus major and minor muscles in your face help pull your expression upwards and outwards in a smile. But what about the sound? That makes others laugh too, said T. Sundari. So when you breathe, air passes through your vocal cords into your lungs. But when you laugh, the air is held back, leading to those rhythmic ha-ha-ha sounds that you cant seem to stop, Anna explained. So, T. Sundari, you understand that laughter is perfectly natural? So long as youre not hurting anyones feelings, theres nothing wrong with a good laugh. T. Sundari felt so much better. Its almost tea time. Shall we have a bonda then? said Skandu Anna, knowing perfectly well what would happen next. T. Sundari couldnt stop laughing. Not even after the bonda was in her belly. Can you do all these laughs?

Do birds really have hair? The hornbills helmet is called a casque (rhymes with mask). Like ear-tufts and crests, casques make hornbills look good. This helps them find mates. A hornbills casque also makes its beak stronger. With a strong beak, hornbills can pick and eat fruits more easily. The furry worms on the owls head are called ear-tufts. They are not really ears, just bits of skin covered with feathers. These help owls hide more easily, making them look like they are part of a tree. The ear-tufts also help them look attractive (to other owls) or scary (to other birds and animals).""}"

It flows over the Starfish. It flows into the tide pools. The water rises. The Pufferfish rises with it. Finally, the baby Pufferfish can swim over the rocks. It is overjoyed. Thank you, everyone! it calls out and swims away into the sea. Goodbye, little one. Swim safe. What is a tide pool? Tide pools are shallow pools of seawater on rocky shores. You find these at low tide when the rest of the water has flowed back into the sea. Tide pools are in the intertidal zone, the part of the beach only seen at low tide. Low tide is when the water flows back far into the sea. High tide is when the water covers most of the shore. Tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon on the Earth.

What is a cyborg? A cyborg is short for cybernetic organism. It is a living thing with artificial body parts that can be controlled by the nervous system. Dadu is curious and wants to know how human beings can function with artificial body parts. Scientists in a field called bionics study the way different parts of the human body work, and design machines to copy these actions. Organs that arent working the way they should can be replaced or supported by these bionic parts, says Aiman. Aiman shows Dadu a drawing of the human body. Some bionic devices have been in use for years, she says. Dadu has heard of some of these devices. A dialysis machine filters blood if the kidneys arent functioning. A pacemaker helps the human heart beat in a regular rhythm and pump blood. Can bionics make me stronger? he asks. Can it help me fly like a bird or run like a cheetah? No! Aiman laughs. But a lost arm or leg can be replaced with a bionic limb that you can control with your brain. ""What if I lost my hearing? My voice? My sight or my sense of taste?"" Dadu wonders. Aiman has the answers: A bionic ear implant to allow Dadu to listen to his favourite radio programmes! A bionic voice box so he can sing along! A bionic eye to help him choose the best fruit from the market! A bionic tongue to taste that fruit! But there are some human organs which cannot be replaced with machines yet, adds Aiman. The human nose, she tells Dadu, can detect up to 10,000 different smells and sends signals to the brain to identify them. Creating a machine as efficient and powerful as the nose may take a while to perfect. Bionics has made great progress and is changing the human body, Dadu. Dadu has a question. Aiman, do you think One day, we could all become cyborgs, says Aiman. ...I am a cyborg already? What do you think? No, Dadu is NOT a cyborg! False teeth are not machines that interact with his brain and nervous system. But here are some people from around the world who could be cyborgs. Artist Neil Harbisson was born with extreme colour blindness or achromatopsia. But he can hear colours that other humans cannot even imagine!

She dreams of climbing over rocks and boulders, scaling snow-capped peaks. She dreams of being a mountaineer. Soon, Sudiptas school days are over and she applies for a physics course in college. There she meets a professor who suggests that she study geology instead. A geologist studies rocks and how they are formed. During the course of her studies, Sudipta collects rock samples, she goes exploring and trekking, she scales mountains and she travels to far and secluded places. She studies rocks from all corners of the world. She wants to understand how Earths forces can cause deformation in rocks. Sudipta continues to study for a long time even after she completes college. Soon she can read a rock like a book. She can tell whether it was involved in an earthquake or was a part of a mountain. She continues climbing mountains. She is given advanced training by Tenzing Norgay, one of the first two men who scaled the mighty Everest. Deep inside Earth, theres a lot of heat and pressure which makes rocks soft. They can deform, which means they can change shape. Closer to the surface, the pressure is less. Here, the rocks can crack. Sometimes, one rock goes through the impact of different forces and periods of time. So it changes shape multiple times. Sudiptas search for rocks takes her on the wildest adventures in the remotest places. Once when shes climbing ridges at Singhbhum, a place known for its wild elephants, her guide shouts, Elephant, elephant! Run, RUN! With a rucksack of rocks, Sudipta runs as fast and as far as her feet can take her. But are there any elephants? No, all she sees are footprints of wild boar and deer. Another time, shes on an expedition to the Scandinavian Caledonides range. Its dusk and shes on a narrow cliff, when suddenly fog sets in. Its so thick she cant even see her own hands. She stands frozen for an hour. Even the slightest movement, and she might fall off the cliff! The next day, she is walking across a lush green valley. Sudipta begins to sink. This isnt grass, its a bog! She gathers all her strength, pulls herself out of the bog and makes it back to the camp. Sudipta hears that there is going to be an expedition to the coldest place in the world, Antarctica. She cant wait to apply! But the expedition is not open to female scientists. A year later, much to her surprise, she gets a telegram calling her for an interview. And the next thing she knows, shes setting sail from Goa to Antarctica. The only other woman scientist on board is Aditi Pant, a marine biologist. According to the Antarctic Treaty, Antarctica is a natural reserve, devoted to peace and science. All countries that have stations there pledge to conduct research only for peaceful and earth-friendly purposes. They also share their findings freely with scientists from other countries. Twenty-three days after setting sail from Goa, the Finnpolaris docks at Antarctica. On board are 83 peoplescientists, engineers, and officers from the armed forces. They will set up Indias first research station, Dakshin Gangotri. The Station was abandoned after it was submerged in ice in the late 1980s. From the deck, Sudipta can see miles and miles of blue and white. No trees, no plants, no animals, no people. Only penguins. On 27 December 1983, Sudipta and Aditi become the first Indian women scientists to set foot on the icy continent. 90 of the worlds ice is located in the Antarctic. Looking for rock samples in Antarctica is not easy. Sudipta always leaves the research station with her clinometer, a special compass that not only shows her the direction but also the incline of the rock. She doesnt know when the ice and rock bridges shes walking on will break, or when the snow will give way to a crevice. Blasts of dry, chilly wind hit her face as she walks on sheets of ice that are 4 km thick. She cannot spot any rocks. Where will she find them? On top of the mountains. In Antarctica, there are mountain peaks that jut out of the ice. Sudipta scales these peaks for her samples, and finds almost 20 kg of rocks which she carries in her rucksack. She spends long hours hammering away at fresh and hard rocks. It is so cold she cant even take off the cap of her pen to take field notes. In summer, the temperature can range between -20 to -30 degrees Celsius and in winter it can go as low as -89 degrees Celsius! Sudipta collects lots of rocks in Antarctica. Big rocks. Small rocks. Rocks with sharp edges. Rocks with lines running across them. She can trace their history back a million years. Some of the rocks have deformation patterns similar to the rocks in South Africa and some have patterns like the ones in South India. Scientists say tens of millions of years ago, the continents of Asia, Africa, Australia, South America and Antarctica were joined together to form one huge landmass called Gondwanaland. Twenty million years ago, it split and began to drift apart to form separate continents. Antarctica settled in the South Pole. Sudipta returns to Antarctica a few years later. Again she walks for miles on ice, treks across mountains, discovers new rocks. She watches, she listens, she writes, and she brings back stories on how the world came to be. Sudipta completed her graduation and post-graduation in Applied Geology. She continued her Ph.D. research in Structural Geology at Jadavpur University. Sudipta was selected to conduct her post-doctoral research at the Imperial College of Science, London. As of 2018, she is the only Indian geologist to have received this fellowship. A STORY SET IN STONE Sudipta pioneered geological study in the Schirmacher Hills in East Antarctica. Many other scientists continued the work she started here. Some awards she has received: the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award (1991), the Antarctic Award (2000) and the D.N. Wadia Medal (2016). Sudipta is a former professor and INSA Senior Scientist at the Department of Geological Sciences, Jadavpur University, Kolkata.'}"

Ijas had been sad when his best friend moved away, but Vikrams letters always cheered him up. He LOVED solving the puzzles that Vikram sent. On the day of Eid, an envelope from Vikram arrives. Ijas opens it and pulls out a card. Eid Mubarak, Ijas! A surprise awaits you. Read the letter. As Ijas opens the letter, he wonders what Vikram has sent him. The last time, it had been a number puzzle. BUT WAIT. The paper is BLANK! Is this a mistake? Is he supposed to turn the piece of paper into something? Ijas tries to fold it. Nothing happens. Ijas holds the paper to the light. He runs his fingers over the surface of the paper. Nothing happens. He rolls it and looks through it. Ijas looks at the card again.

It was his second week at the new school but he still had no friends. Every time he approached his classmates, he encountered a closed circ le. The football team had enough players. The art club was full. Everyone had their own groups. During break, he saw a circle of classmates near the library, throwing darts and counting the holes on a dartboard. Pintu wondered what they were doing but he couldnt muster the courage to ask. He moved away from the closed circle towards the one thing that always made him happy. Numbers. Pintu went to the library. He leafed through a book on shapes . A teacher spotted him. Have you ever made a circle with a compass? he asked Pintu. Pintu shook his head. Im Mr Ahmed, the senior maths teacher, he said, taking out a box from a drawer. From this box, he took out a sharp, pointy thing that Pintu had never seen before. This is a compass. This sharp point is fixed on paper. Then you move the pencil around the fixed point or the centre. The distance between the pencil and the centre is always the same. And by the time you get back to where you started, you get a..."" Circle! exclaimed Pintu. Pintu quickly learnt to draw a circle with a compass. He drew circles of varying sizes. He learnt that the path traced by the pencil was the circumference of the circle. The fixed distance between the circumference and the centre was the radius. Now, tell me, how would you divide the circle in half? Mr Ahmed asked. Pintu thought for a bit. He drew a line through the centre, slicing the circle in two. Mr Ahmed clapped. Pintu drew more lines cutting the circle into many parts. It looks like the spokes of a wheel, he said. Mr Ahmed showed Pintu how all the lines passed through the centre of the circle. Then he measured the lines and told Pintu that each of these made up the diameter of the circle. If the diameter is 10 centimetres, how long is the radius? he asked. Pintu looked at the circle carefully. Five centimetres, he said. Exactly, Mr Ahmed applauded. The diameter is always twice the radius. Now I can introduce you to the endless magic of pi! Pintu beamed. But then DRRRRNG! It was time for class. Back in class, Pintu sat in silence. He was happy. He was thinking about the circles he saw everyday wheels, coins, rotis and plates. He didnt even look up when the teacher announced a class picnic. The other students were delighted. They decided to bring hula hoops, skipping ropes and footballs for the picnic. The next day, the class was buzzing. Pintu realised that he was surrounded by circles. Big, bright hula hoops. Suddenly someone shouted, Look at Pintus hula hoop, and some of the children began laughing. Pintu had brought an old, grey cycle tyre. He wanted to disappear. Again, he could feel the circle closing, leaving him out. The other children ran out to play football. Pintu was left alone. Ah Pintu, the teacher said. Its not whats on the outside that matters. Its whats inside. Just like pi. Mr Ahmed grabbed a big, shiny hula hoop from the pile in the corner. Then he held up Pintus tyre. Why are you still in class, Pintu? Mr Ahmed asked. Pintu shrugged. They laughed at my ugly circle. And look at theirsso pretty, so colourful, so big. Divide the length of the circumference of this hula hoop by its diameter, Mr Ahmed said, handing Pintu a tape measure. Pintu got busy measuring and calculating. The circumference of the hula hoop was 129 cm and its diameter was 41 cm. Pintu used the calculator and got 3.1463. Great! Now divide the circumference of your tyre by its diameter. Pintu got to work. To his amazement, the number was very close to the first. 3.14768 Whatever the size of your circlewhether it is a one rupee coin or the earths equator, you will find pi. Whether it is a shiny hula hoop or an old cycle tyre, you will find pi, Mr Ahmed said. Mr Ahmed grinned. When we divide the circumference of any circle by its diameter, the number we get is always about 3.14. This is called pi. Always? asked Pintu. Pintu looked at his tyre and understood what Mr Ahmed was trying to tell him. When it came to the laws of mathematics, his tyre was just as good as a fancy hula hoop. Pintu realised that circles may appear to be closed but they had an open mystery inside them. Sir, would you say pi is an endless mystery? The bell rang. Look for the book on pi in the library, Mr Ahmed suggested. Pintu hurried to the library. The first page on the book was like this: Pi is 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097494459230 781640628620899862803482534211706798214808651328230664709384460955 058223172535940812848111745028410270193852110555964462294895493038196442881097566593344612847564823378678316527120190914564856692346 034861045432664821339360726024914127372458700660631558817488152092 096282925409171536436789259036001133053054882046652138414695194151 160943305727036575959195309218611738193261179310511854807446237996 274956735188575272489122793818301194912983367336244065664308602139 494639522473719070217986094370277053921717629317675238467481846766 940513200056812714526356082778577134275778960917363717872146844090 122495343014654958537105079227968925892354201995611212902196086403 44181598136 2953311686172785588907509838175463746493931925506040092 770167113900984882401285836160356370766010471018194295559619894676 783744944825537977472684710404753464620804668425906949129331367702 898915210475216205696602405803815019351125338243003558764024749647 326391419927260426992279678235478163600934172164121992458631503028 6182974555706749838505494588586926995 Pintu found that the number went on FOREVER! With NO pattern! 121212 has a pattern. So does 1234876512348765. But with pi, he couldnt see any pattern. He sat in the library and read about pi for a long, long time. Pintu was delighted when he came across the sentence \'May I have a large container of coffee?\' in the library book. This sentence would help him to remember the value of pi: 3.1415926 May has three letters, so that is 3. I has one letter, so that is 1. Have has four letters, so that is 4. And the pattern continues. Pintu was delighted. He wondered if he could create such sentences in his mother tongue too. Pintu continued reading. Suddenly, he heard voices. He looked out of the window to see a group of older boys and girls playing a game at the dartboard. He was curious and joined them. Im Pintu, he said. He realised they were doing an activity to approximate pi using darts! Pintu smiled and said, Ive been reading about pi. I know what this is. The boys and girls formed a circle around Pintu. As he counted the holes, he began calculating and the answer was 3.14159. There was a loud cheer. Pintu was finally part of a circle. He felt a sense of wonder. Like pi, he knew it would be endless. Pi is all about endless numbers and possibilities. One way to approximate pi is to throw darts at a dartboard. The board is a square with a circle that touches the centre of each side of the square. Dont aim at the centre of the circle, but throw the darts randomly at the board several times (the more, the better). The number of darts that hit the board within the circle divided by the number of darts that hit the board is a ratio that is close to pi4. Multiply that number by 4 to get an approximation of pi. Pi has fascinated people around the world since ancient times. They compete to memorise the digits. In 2015, a boy from India named Rajveer Meena recited 70,000 digits of pi in 10 hours. He set a Guinness World Record! The genius Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, in his time, had the fastest formula to calculate the digits of pi.'}"

Wipprechts spider dress has a collar of robotic spider legs, fitted with servo motors. The closer someone gets to the dress wearer, the more aggressively the dress reacts and the spider legs unfurl. The legs retract when the danger goes away. SANGHAMITRA BANDYOPADHYAY FOLLOW THE PATTERN Professor Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay works with algorithmsrules written for a computer to follow and solve problems. Algorithms also help you identify patterns. Bandyopadhyay has received some of the biggest science prizes in India, like the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award in Engineering Science in 2010 and the Infosys Award in 2017. She is also the first woman director of the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. BIOLOGY BASICS At school, biology was Bandyopadhyays least favourite subject. She loved science and decided to study physics first and then computer science. She began working with biology research and realised that, when put in order with the help of computer science, it could be a lot of fun. CODES AND CELLS What kind of patterns can Bandyopadhyay identify? She and her team study molecules and cells that cause diseases like cancer. Bandyopadhyay sifts through mountains of information from biological experiments. She organises this information and feeds it to the computers to find patterns. She says her algorithms can be applied to any field. FERESHTEH FOROUGH A team of 20 students from Code to Inspire has created a game called Fight Against Opium. The game traces an Afghan soldier on a mission to destroy poppy fields, and depicts the challenges the army faces in fighting against drugs and the Taliban. LITERATURE TO LOGIC Fereshteh Forough didnt like maths one bit. She had studied literature in Iran where her Afghan parents had fled during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. When they moved back, Forough got into the computer science programme at Herat University. She hated the first day. There were just too many numbers. The next day, she learnt about algorithms and she was hooked. CODE TO INSPIRE After studying computer science, Forough wanted to start something that would help make girls financially independent and more confident. She started Afghanistans first coding school for women, Code to Inspire, from her apartment. Many women who study there have never worked on a computer before. BE A CREATOR Learning a new languagethats what coding is like for Forough. It gives you the power to create what you want, and to pass on that power to others. AUDREY TANG NOT SO BOOKISH Tang wrote her first game when she was eight to help her younger brother with fractions. At 15, she told her teachers that textbooks were outdated and she wanted to study coding. Tang dropped out of school. She learnt coding through online communities, hackathons and webinars. THE DIGITAL MINISTER Audrey Tang is Taiwans Digital Minister, and the first transgender person in the countrys cabinet. ALL IN THE OPEN Tang worked in the startup space in the USA before moving back to Taiwan. In August 2016, Tang joined the Taiwanese government. She is trying to bring about a digital revolution in the administration and to make it paperless. She believes in free software and social entrepreneurship, and has helped set up social innovation labs in Taiwan. Two years before she joined the government, Tang resigned from her job at Silicon Valley to help students back home in their protest against the government. MARGARET HAMILTON KATHERINE JOHNSON TWO FIRSTS Hamilton later became the programming head at NASAs Apollo 11 project that took man to the moon. Her team created the software to run the worlds first portable computers that went aboard the spacecraft. This was the earliest version of a computerised navigation system. There was an error three minutes before Apollo 11s moon landing. Hamilton resolved the error and the mission could go ahead. STRONG CORE When Margaret Hamilton was in school, you couldnt learn computer programming because the field of software engineering did not exist. Hamilton, a mathematics student, was part of the team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the USA that developed the core concepts in computer programming. Astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon on July 20, 1969. Armstrong couldnt have reached the moon without Margaret Hamilton or Katherine Johnson. PATH LESS TRODDEN Mathematician Katherine Johnson was also part of the team. She calculated the exact trajectory or path the spacecraft would take to the moon for the Apollo 11 and Apollo 13 missions. She has been commemorated in a movie titled Hidden Figures . GRACE HOPPER Hopper was the first to use the word bug to refer to a problem with the computer and the first woman to earn a PhD in Mathematics from Yale University in 1934. CANNONS AND COMPUTERS Mathematics Professor Grace Hopper left her job to join the United States Navy Reserve better known as WAVES. She became a Lieutenant during World War II. A year before the war ended, she began her work on programming Harvard Universitys Mark I computer. Hopper later joined the team that programmed UNIVAC I, the worlds first large-scale electronic computer. She rose to the rank of Rear Admiral during her career. LANGUAGE NO BARRIER Back then, you had to give instructions to a computer using numbers or computer code. Hopper invented an early compiler. The compiler was a program that translated human language to machine language for the computer. On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by the US President Barack Obama. ADA LOVELACE AHEAD OF HER TIMES A century before the Bombethe first single-use computing devicewas built, Ada Lovelace had already written the worlds first computer program. Lovelace mastered university-level maths by exchanging letters with Augustus De Morgan, a maths professor in London. A MACHINE NEVER BUILT Lovelaces friend, the inventor Charles Babbage, designed a machine called the Analytical Engine. It could have become the earliest known programmable computer, which could be programmed using punched cards. Though the machine was never built, Lovelace, who was a mathematician, translated an Italian article on the engine and also described an algorithm explaining how it could be programmed, making it the worlds first computer program. MATHEMAGICIAN One of Lovelaces programs showed how the machine could calculate the BernouIli Numbers, a complex series of numbers, if you gave it the right formula. She was also the first to suggest that the machine could be instructed to do much more than just mathseven make art and music. 100 Years of Coding GRETE HERMANN 1901-1984 She was a German mathematician whose work is considered the foundation of computer algebra. Her critique of the no-hidden-variable theorem by John von Neumann was ignored for three decades, until it was independently discovered and published by John Stewart Bell in 1966. RZSA PTER (RSA POLITZER) 1905-1977 This mathematician is known as the founder of Recursive Function Theory, a branch of mathematical logic and computer science. In 1952, she became the first Hungarian woman to be made an Academic Doctor of Mathematics. WOMEN IN BLETCHLEY PARK 1937-1945 During World War II, women secretly worked as code-breakers at Bletchley Park. RADIA PERLMAN 1951-PRESENT This American computer programmer is known for the algorithm she wrote for the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) which has influenced the way networks and data are organised. DAME STEPHANIE STEVE SHIRLEY 1933-PRESENT Dame Steve Shirley came to England as a five-year-old Jewish refugee during World War II. She learned to make computers from scratch and even code in the 1950s. With 6, Shirley started the software company Freelance Programmers in 1962 which later became Xansa. By 1975, out of the 300 programmers the company had, 297 were women. ABISOYE AJAYI-AKINFOLARIN Abisoye launched Girl Coding in Nigeria in 2015 to help girls from underserved communities become developers. She aims to bring 20,000 female programmers into the Nigerian tech ecosystem by the year 2020. ADITI PRASAD DEEPTI RAO The two siblings founded Indian Girls Code in 2013. Under this initiative, young underserved girls are taught coding, robotics and how to develop real-world programs for real-world applications.

Earth is angry today. Really, really, angry. Aru is at it again. She is, for the twentieth time, preparing to fly like the superheroes in her comics. And for the twentieth time, she screams, Aaarrrrrrgh! Gravity, I haaaate you! Pffff! Thats so unfair, mutters Earth. Gravity is an amazing force. Air, plants, animals, mountains, oceans, stars, houses, cars and schools, Aru and even menone of us would be where we are if it werent for gravity! But how do I get Aru to see this? Earth hatches a plan. Hello, Aru. This is Earth. Since you hate gravity so much, I have decided to take it away. Please fly around as much as you want to. Of course, you will have to catch your cape first! Wh a a a a... A aa a a aa aa a ! Nooo oo oo ! Eee ee eee eee ! Whoaahhhhh! Please, please, stop! I called gravity silly because I want to fly. But now everything is flying, says Aru. Hm mm pppph! You think all gravity does is stop you from flying? Huh? What else does it do apart from keeping me on the ground? Aru asks. Earth sighs and explains, Gravity is an invisible force that makes everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, around us pull or attract each other. It keeps all things in order. Without it, all things, even you and I, would just float away and disappear into space. Poof! Aru is quick to ask, But where is all this pulling? I dont see it at all. Well observed, Aru! Everything is indeed pulling on each other all the time. You just dont see or feel it because I am the heaviest object around you. And my pull is the strongest. So I pull everything to myself and keep us all grounded. And my pull is the strongest around you because I have the most mass. Remember, greater the mass, stronger the pull, says Earth. Mass is the amount of matter or stuff in an object. Hmmmand the moon? Its pretty big too. And Jupiter? Aru asks. Ah, now youre really beginning to catch on, Aru. The moon is much lighter than me, so it doesnt pull you as hard as I do. But it is close enough to pull the water in our oceans and create tides. You see, the farther the object, the lesser its pull. Now take the planet Jupiterits the largest one we have in our solar system. It does have a much, much larger mass, but because its so far away, it makes the pull weaker than that of the moon. The universe is full of things heavier than Earth. Like the sun. It pulls Earth and the other planets, and makes them move around it. This also creates days, months, years and seasons, summer holidays, and even special days like birthdays. There are many planets and stars that are heavier than Earth but they are so far away that their pull has little effect on our planet. Aru is quiet for a while. Suddenly, she flaps her arms, and says, But I do want to fly! Fly, fly, fly away! And you will. You could learn to pilot a plane when you grow up, or take off to the moon in a rocket. Aru is thrilled to hear this. Yes, one day, I WILL fly! Now can you please turn gravity back on again? What did you break now, Aru? It wasnt me, Ma. It was gravity! Aaaarrrrghhhh! What do you think would change on Earth if the moon turned into Jupiter? Why does Earth not fall into the sun? What do you think would change on Earth if the moon moved 10 times farther away? Could a bird fly if there was no air?'}"

The stagnant grey air weaves its way into her eyes, her nose, her mouth, her ears. Ma, Im home! says Nayantara. Have you seen what its like outside? she says, gasping for breath. Its the pollution, Ma says. The air quality index is supposed to be between 50 and 100. Today it is 463. Schools are shut for the next few days and the government says we shouldnt leave the house. Nayantara and her friend Aliza arent happy. They had planned to play football in the park. Looking at the grey-brown world outside the window, Nayantara tells Aliza that she misses the fresh air. Me too, says Aliza. I dreamt last night that I lived in a house in the treetops. The oxygen around me was pure and fresh. But trees only produce oxygen during the day. What will happen at night when the trees spew carbon dioxide? asks Ma with a smile. My dream didnt have those details planned out, Aliza giggles. Aliza! Nayantara says suddenly. Lets invent an artificial leaf that only breathes out oxygen. That way, we will have an endless supply of fresh air. Aliza imagines a forest full of artificial leaves, pumping out fresh oxygen, day and night, for the world to breathe. Invent our own leaf? asks Aliza doubtfully. Yes. A photosynthesis machine, says Nayantara. A machine that takes in sunlight and carbon dioxide and gives out oxygen and also creates energy. The way a plant does. It might actually work. What do you say, Ma? Ma thinks about it for a minute. It would be complicated but it could work. The girls start writing down the details. Carbon dioxide plus water, in the presence of sunlight, gives glucose and oxygen. The plant splits water molecules to generate hydrogen and oxygen. Oxygen is released into the atmosphere, while hydrogen combines with carbon dioxide within the plant. Glucose is created and used by the plant as food. The girls take Mas help and begin researching on how to create leaves that spout oxygen day and night. An artificial leaf will need a catalyst that can use light energy from the sun to split water into oxygen and hydrogen, Ma says. The hydrogen and oxygen need to be kept apart once they split up, or else the gases could cause an explosion. So we need a membrane to separate the oxygen from hydrogen, says Nayantara. Its not easy trying to create an artificial leaf. No, it is not easy, but imagine an artificial leaf will give us all the oxygen we need. Not only that, the glucose it produces can also provide chemical energy. Imagine producing electricity from all that glucose fuel! Aliza tells Nayantara. Think about what this would mean! Nayantara says. Remote villages will have electricity all the time. Children will not have to struggle to study in poorly-lit rooms. Small factories can be set up without worrying about power. Nayantaras mother tells the girls that a scientist at Harvard University, in USA, has been trying to create an artificial leaf that converts sunlight into electricity. But a lot more work is needed for it to become the real thing. What does this artificial leaf look like? Aliza asks. Almost like a sandwich. It has silicon, cobalt and nickel, and only needs water to create energy, says Ma. She also tells them that scientists are working on finding methods to store the energy it generates. Aliza and Nayantara are excited that researchers far away are working on such an artificial leaf. They picture a world full of such a technology, where machines wont spew black smoke. Air will not be heavy and thick. The skies will not be grey. Imagine a world without petrol pumps, Aliza says. Imagine aeroplanes and cars with artificial leaves on their roofs. One day, all we will need is sunlight and water, and an artificial leaf will be able to create fuel and oxygen. The girls look out of the window and dream of a house with a big artificial leaf on its roof. Artificial leaf technology is promising. Nathan Lewis at Caltech and Daniel Nocera at Harvard University, in the USA, are racing to create the first artificial leaf. While one stream of research wants to create a leaf that will harness sunlight into hydrogen, the other stream of research is looking at harnessing sunlight to produce carbon-containing fuels that can replace petrol. These products will be stored in tanks, and fed into a fuel cell when electricity is needed. The most efficient plants barely convert more than 1 percent of the sunlight into stored energy. The artificial leaf plans to change that. The challenge is to create devices that can collect, store and use the gases produced by the artificial leaf.'}"

He comes to the surface of the water, breathes deeply and then dives. Razia tries to swim like the dolphin. She lifts her head out of water, gulps some air and dives back in. As the days go by, Razia watches more and more animals swim. She learns many new moves. Razia kicks. She floats. She wiggles. She dives. She holds her breath for longer and longer. She swims faster and faster. Razia, it's time to go! yells Ummachi. Can I swim just a little bit longer? Pleeease, Ummachi? Have You Tried Swimming? Different animals have different ways of moving through water. Tuna and dolphins are shaped to shoot through the water with great speed. Tiny plankton drift wherever the water takes them. Squid and octopuses draw water in and expel it very fast. Try some of these moves the next time you step into the water! Eagle rays flap their wings. Crabs and lobsters walk on the seafloor.

My food has wings! laughs Inku. Bats are my favourite, says Ma. GOBBLE, GOBBLE. So chewy! I love its squishy insides. AAAAA! Inku opens her bill wide, seeing a big and furry creature. Here comes a squirrel, laughs Pa. SHOOP, SHOOP , the squirrel slides in. It tickles! This looks a little like us, whispers Inku. Yes, its a small bird a bulbul, says Pa. GULP, GULP. Aaaalll gone! BURP! So many hands and legs! yells Inku. Its a scorpion. Beat it against the tree to make it soft, says Ma. DISH! DASH! BAM! ""Wow. Ouch. Still so sharp! ""Are these long lizards?"" asks Inku. No, these are snakes. Slurp them up! says Ma, grinning. OOOSH, OOOSH, OOOOOOSH , the snakes disappear one by one. What fun! I think snakes are my favourite. Inku soon grows big and strong, and leaves the nest. HOP, HOP, HOP , from one branch to the next. She is so excited to explore the forest and catch her own food! Shiny berries. Slippery frogs. Jumping grasshoppers. What will Inku find today? Meet the Great Hornbill The Great Hornbill is Indias largest hornbill. Adult Great Hornbills are 3 to 4 feet tall almost as tall as you are! Inkus parents found a large hollow in a big, sturdy tree. Ma entered it and shed some feathers because she would not be leaving the nest for almost three months. Ma and Pa then sealed the entrance, leaving only a small slit open. This is where Inku hatched from an egg. She lived in this nest for 10-12 weeks, until she was old enough to come out. Pa hornbills are very busy during nesting, because Ma hornbills cannot leave the nest. Pa hornbills fly far and wide to bring a variety of tasty and nutritious food for the chick and the mother because they are very hungry all the time.'}"

Thundering in the sky, They bulge and rumble and grow, Till water bursts, in pouring rain, Down to the earth again. How to Ride the Water Cycle Water travels far and takes many forms over the course of the water cycle. It comes to the earth as rain from the sky. It fills rivers and soaks into the ground to join the water table. The water table, like a river underground, emerges into open air in the form of springs and lakes. Water travels up into the sky as vapour when it's warmed by the sun, and comes together as wispy clouds. When clouds grow dark and heavy with water, they open with pouring rain, bringing water back to earth once more.""}"

She loves them because she knows numbers can solve problems. Numbers help build patterns and stories. Numbers connect people. They also give people power. This is what she does at SocialCops, a company she has started with her friend Varun. Prukalpas favourite numbers involve collecting large quantities of information about people. This is called data. These days, people say, data is more valuable than oil or gold. Why is that? How can a few numbers, or even many numbers, be worth more than some of the most valuable things in the world? Lets take your school, and you, for example. You didnt go to school twice this week. You had a stomach bug. It made you vomit. It gave you cramps. It doesnt seem very important information to anybody else. Only your parents, teachers and you care, right? But what if five other children in your class were also sick on the same days? Often what happens to you isnt just about you. What if their stomach cramps kept them home too? If the principal got this information, she might wonder why six students of a class fell ill in the same way on the same day? Was it the lunch served at school? Could it be the water they drank in school? This is how information about groups can be very useful. When information about your classmates is put together in one place, it becomes community data. Community data is information about a group of people related to each other, like you and your classmates. This data comes from each of you. It is crowdsourced, which means it has been collected from people. This is how Prukalpa uses numbers or data. She collects it to solve problems, and to help manage schools, cities and lives better. 5 crore women 13 states, 640 districts, 50,000 field mechanics, 3 oil companies, 10,000 LPG distribution centres People impacted Areas Other resources CLEAN COOKING FUEL IN 3 YEARS In 11 months, SocialCops helped distribute 2.7 crore LPG connections. INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS AND INTERNET 1 crore women 12 states, 1 lakh villages People impacted Areas BETTER HYGIENE AND SANITATION LEVELS BY BRINGING ANTIBACTERIAL SOAP TO VILLAGES Areas Diseases tracked 822 sub-districts 20 diseases tracked for 260 weeks How do Prukalpa and her team get information that government officers and other organisations need to make decisions? The team puts a simple tool called Collect on peoples phones. This makes it possible for the team to gather useful data from people anywhere in the world. When you have so many tiny bits of information from individuals, you end up with a massive heap of data. What Prukalpas team does is clean up the information and organise it. Its similar to the way you arrange your desk so you can find pens, papers and other material when you look for them. How do they do it? They use powerful computer systems and codes to create connections among different kinds of data. These connections would be very difficult to make without computer systems. They also use charts, maps and graphs to show how data can link to each other. The data begins to tell stories. The connections become easy to understand. Prukalpa loves what she does. She loves being an entrepreneur. But it takes relentless hard work to set up a company. To work in small villages that are tough to reach, to work with government departments that might not be ready to try new ideas, and to help people understand why they should value data. In most places in India, information is still recorded in paper registers. It isnt available in digital form, which means it is difficult to manage. Also, many government agencies collect data but they dont work with each other to combine this data in one place. Organising data that is already available has been the biggest challenge for Prukalpa and her team. What has also been tough is realising that change is a slow, difficult journey-built data by data, person by person. As an entrepreneur, this is exactly the kind of work Prukalpa wanted to do when she started out. She decided that her love for numbers shouldnt be used by a large corporate alone. What keeps her going is the satisfaction that comes from making an impact by seeing lives improve and enabling better decisions.

Its an egg laid by an alien, said Naina. Its a ball made of cheese, said Madhav. So they decided to find out. But we better get back in time for dinner, Madhav said. We dont want to find out what Aais anger is made of. It took them exactly eleven minutes to get lost. Wheres the moon? They asked a glowing unicorn for directions. How come youre so shiny? Do you know what the moon is made of? What are you made of? The unicorn didnt have time for their questions. Chomp! Crrunch! Gulp! If I stop eating, I\'ll never turn into a gorgeous rhinoceros , she said. Before Naina and Madhav could say anything else , they heard loud sobs in the distance. Waaaaaaah! Aiyeeeee! WOE IS ME! the new voice wailed. Will I be trapped in here forever? Stop moaning! growled another voice. It sounds like somebody needs our help, said Naina. We can be heroes of the sky, said Madhav. Look out for the swan, warned the unicorn, before going back to her food. Naina and Madhav found a surprising sight. An angry queen was guarding a locked tower. A weeping dragon peeked through the window. ""Why have you kidnapped a dragon? Naina asked the queen. ""Because he is a no-good thief! the queen snapped. ""He stole my hair while I was sleeping and now he wont give it back. I cant get it back! the dragon cried. Its too dangerous. Nainas eyes lit up. Where theres danger, theres adventure. And every adventure needs a brave hero! said Madhav. Heroes, you mean, said Naina. We will rescue your hair! The dragon agreed to tell them where the hair was. But he refused to go near it. A giant fire-breathing dragon is afraid of a harmless swan. Naina shook her head. The swan probably doesnt even know that the hair is stolen, Madhav replied. We should just ask him to return it, Naina suggested. Things did not go according to plan. Hiss! Snort! Flap! The swan spread his wings and attacked the spaceship. Then he chased them across the sky. By the time they escaped the swan, Madhav and Nainas stomachs were growling with hunger. They looked at the clock in the sky and gasped. Were late, were late! Madhav said. They revved the engine of their spaceship. vooRRR! vooRRR! The engine sputtered and came to a halt. Vwomp! Pssssh! The siblings panicked. Were stuck! How do we get back home? Aai will be so angry! Im so hungry! They turned to the stars for help. The dragon had a blocked nose because of all the weeping. They couldnt ride his flames home. The flying horse had sent his wings to the dry cleaner. He couldnt fly them home. The strongest man in space had fractured his arm. He couldnt throw them home. Were doomed! But the dragon had another idea. The two children climbed aboard an arrow. The centaur took careful aim and shot them right to their front door. We never did find out what the moon is made of, said Madhav. Who cares about that? I want to know what stars are made of! said Naina, her eyes full of another adventure. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Meet the Star-Creatures 1. Monoceros the unicorn 2. Draco the dragon 3.

Sagittarius the centaur Shapes in the Sky A constellation is a group of stars which forms an imaginary pattern when you look at the sky. These patterns are formed by the brightest stars in the sky. The patterns can be animals and objects, mythological people, gods and creatures, and scenes from ancient stories. In 1922, astronomers divided the sky into 88 constellations. Constellations are useful because they can help people recognise stars in the sky. In ancient times, people used constellations to help keep track of the calendar so that they knew when to plant and harvest crops. Sailors and travellers also used constellations as guides to help them find their way. If youre looking for constellations and cant find the images described in this book, don\'t worry! The stars dont look exactly like the image youre expecting to see. You might need a star map to spot the stars in the constellations.'}"

We need to get to higher ground where well be safer. Lajjo and her family wade through the water with great difficulty. With the help of some army men, they reach a hill where their neighbours have moved to. Oh, no! I left Gudiya behind, cries Lajjo. She never goes anywhere without her doll! But Babu says that they cant go back until things are better. The next morning, Lajjo asks if she can go find Gudiya. This time, Mai yells at her. Lajjo, our home is under five feet of water. We are running out of drinking water, and all you care about is a doll. Dont worry, Lajjo. Gudiya will be fine, says Daadu. Shall we play a game? A game! says Lajjo, brightening up. Yes! Its a scavenger hunt. You have to find all the items on this list. As soon as you do, I will show you something amazing. Lajjo looks at Daadus list.

What is it, Lajjo? asks Mai, sounding tired. If you are thirsty, I dont have any drinking water. No Mai, Babu gave me a sip of water. I need a cotton cloth. Do you have one? Mai doesnt have a spare cloth. So she cuts a piece from her cotton sari. Here! Take this. Lajjo gives Mai a big hug. Babu helps Lajjo find a bucket. She fills it with sand. Yay! Three things off my list! Lajjo, Im thirsty. Do you have some water? asks her friend Prateek. Sorry, Prateek. We finished all our water. Thats okay, he says. Are you looking for something? Im looking for gravel, says Lajjo. There! You can use that. Only two more things for Lajjo to find! Then Lajjo goes to find the village carpenter. Fixer Baba, Fixer Baba, may I borrow your hammer and hole punch? What is it for, Lajjo? Its for a game Im playing with Daadu, she says. A game! Who has time for games when the whole village is thirsty? Though he grumbles a little, he gives the tools to Lajjo. Lajjo lays out all the items in front of Daadu. Done! she says proudly. Daadu smiles and turns the bucket over. He makes a hole in it with the hammer and punch. Lajjo watches eagerly as he places the cotton cloth at the bottom of the bucket. Then, he pours fine sand over the cloth into the bucket. Lajjo, will you help me fill the bucket with gravel? asks Daadu. Lajjo helps Daadu pick out all the tiny stones, and put them in the bucket. They then fill the bucket with larger stones. Daadu takes a bottle filled with muddy river water and pours it into the bucket. Why did you do that? Lajjo asks, puzzled. Daadu just smiles. Not long after, clear water starts dripping down from the hole in the bucket. Daadu collects it in a glass. Lajjo, we made a filter that changes muddy water into clean water, says Daadu. Go give this glass of water to your Mai and Babu. Mai and Babu are overjoyed! They boil the water and drink it. Soon Prateek, Fixer Baba, Mai and Babu surround the bucket. Great work, Lajjo! they cheer. The next day, the army comes in boats laden with supplies for the flood survivors. Lajjos family is relieved. And in their boat is a special surprise for Lajjo! Make Your Own Water Filter Materials Needed: - 1 plastic bottle - 1 pair of scissors - 1 clean cotton cloth - Sand - Gravel (fine and coarse) What to Do Use a pair of scissors to cut off the bottom of the water bottle. Punch a small hole in the bottle cap with the pair of scissors. Stuff the bottom of the bottle with a cotton cloth. Pour fine sand into the bottle till the 14 mark. Fill the bottle with fine gravel till the 12 mark, followed by coarse gravel till the 34 mark. Pour water slowly from the top. You will find clean water dripping down from the bottom. Note: Boil the water before drinking it in order to kill harmful germs.'}"

When he first met her at the hospital, Chinnu was small and hairless. Vava was terrified to hold her because she was soft and looked like a pink worm. Now she has black hair, just like him. Her nose is round and snub, just like Ammammas nose! And her eyes are the same colour as Ammas, and Ammas sister Banu Chittas. grandmother in Malayalam mothers sister in Malayalam Its amazing, Vava tells Banu Chitta, whose stomach is looking more and more like a big, hard egg these days. At first, Chinnu was just a speck in Ammas stomach, like the baby in your tummy. Now Chinnu looks a little like all of us! Chitta says, What do you think this one will look like? When Amma was pregnant with Chinnu, she had explained that Chinnu was taking her time to grow in Ammas belly. She would come out only when she was strong, and ready to meet the world. Chitta, your bump is smaller than Ammas was when Chinnu was inside her. Are you sure theres a baby in there? Haha, very sure, Chitta says. This baby is still a very small combination of cells. But it is hard at work in there. All the cells are dividing and multiplying. Slowly, they will form groups of cells that will become eyes and ears and all the other organs. Ah! I know what a cell is, says Vava. He leans out of the window to grab a pomegranate from a tree. If this fruit is like an organ, then each seed is like a cell! he says. Vava knows that a cell is the smallest and most basic unit of life in the body not just in his body, but in every organism. Yes, Vava, cells are the building blocks that make up all living things, says Chitta. But if all living things are made of cells, Vava says, then a cell could become anything, right? My new cousin could be a panda! Chitta laughs. Then, well call the baby Panda Anda! I dont want Panda Anda! Vava says, stomping his feet. Cells are smart, Vava, Chitta says. Each cell carries information about the job it will do and what it will become. This information is called DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid. What does DNA look like? asks Vava. DNA is like a spiral ladder, and it has two strands which look something like noodles, says Chitta. It contains a set of instructions called genes that comes from both parents. This reminds Vava of the noodles he saw in the kitchen. So I got these genes from Amma? asks Vava, holding up two strands of noodles playfully. Half Amma and half Appa. One set of genes from Amma and one set from Appa, says Banu Chitta. So Panda Anda would be a panda if his or her parents were pandas. Instead the baby has me for a mother and your uncle for a father, explains Banu Chitta. So thats how a cell knows what it is! It is in the DNA! Vava says. But how does Panda Anda know how to make skin and hair and eyes and fingers? asks Vava. Inside all our cells is a blueprint, Chitta explains. You remember the architect had shared a blueprint of this house with your mother when it was being built? Oh, yes, Vava says. That is how we knew where the windows, doors, walls and the roof would go. Our DNA is like this blueprint. It tells our cells where to go and when to start building, says Chitta. As each cell divides and multiplies, the gene instructs it to become an eye, a finger or a pair of lungs. So each living being is really like a house thats building itself, Vava says. Thats amazing. It is, Chitta agrees. And it keeps building and repairing itself for the rest of our lives. Thats why you are growing so tall! I dont have to do anything to grow, Vava says, giggling. My DNA is doing it for me. Well, you have to treat it nicely, Chitta says. Eat well, sleep well and give your body the right amount of work. Then it will do its job easily and efficiently. I will, I promise! says Vava. TRIVIA SNAP Do you know how many cells are there in an average human body? Scientists say there are about 37.2 trillion. Cells are very, very small and can only be seen under a microscope. If every cell in your hand was the size of a grain of sand, your hand would be the size of a school bus. MAKE YOUR FAMILY TREE Draw your family. Try to find features you or your parents or siblings might have received from someone in the family tree. Does your brothers crazy hair come from Uncle Prithvi in Nagpur or Aunty Binbin in Palampur? Does your cousin get her dimple from her grandmother?'}"

You know, snakes are just like people. Yeah. In so many ways. Were beautiful. Were colourful. We love to dress up. (Indian Rock Python) (Malabar Pit Viper) (Ornate Flying Snake) Just like some people prefer to sit alone with a book, we like to be left alone too. Yeah. Dhaman and I dont really enjoy each others company. Weve just come together for this book. Sigh. The things we do for you! But there are some differences. And thats what makes us snakes! Unlike most people, were unable to hear sounds. We cant digest ten idlis... or drink milk. UGH! But we LOVE our food! But our sharp tongues and the Jacobsons organ on the roof of our mouths give us a keen sense of smell. Checkered Keelbacks love fish and frogs. Shieldtails love earthworms. Vinesnakes and King Cobras eat other snakes. SLURRRRPPP ! Most of us love rats and mice. We eat all the pests that destroy your crops. Remember, snakes down here on the ground are very frightened of humans, even children, towering over them. The only time we bite is in defence. Most snakes found in India are non-venomous and harmless to people. Like ME! Yeah, but Dhaman can inflict a really stinky odour. Hey, thats just my defence mechanism! But there are four common venomous snake species including YOU! Right. Theyre responsible for 50,000 human deaths from snakebites in India every year. Most bites are accidents that can be easily avoided, if you get to know us better. So lets meet the Big Four venomous snakes! Sorry, Im using four grass strands because I dont have fingers. THE BIG FOUR 1. Spectacled Cobra I can easily be identified by my hood and characteristic markings. I am a great swimmer and love to hang out around water. My appetite for rats brings me to fields, houses, messy kitchens and granaries. When Im threatened, my first response is NOT to bite. I do everything I can to warn you to stay away: raise my hood, hiss, and even make false strikes with my mouth closed. Its only when none of this works or if someone steps on me, grabs me or injures me, that I am forced to bite. My venom can prove lethal. Raised hood: stay away. False strike (with the mouth closed): you need to back off right now. Actual strike: you need an ambulance! 2. Saw-scaled Viper Most people think Im harmless because Im tiny. Yep. Really tiny. But my venom is very potent and I can strike with lighting speed! I hang out in dry, open areas. I am difficult to spot because of my camouflage. So if youre playing in these fields, you need to be watchful for me. But dont you worry; Im not that difficult to identify! You can tell I'm a Saw-scaled Viper by the zigzag patterns on my back. I too warn before I bite. I coil up like a jalebi and hiss, with my scales rubbing against each other making a saw-like sound. (Yes, thats where I get my name!) Hissss: this means This isnt a jalebi you would want to touch Strike: Told you so! 3. Common Krait Namaste! Im among the most docile of snakes... and yet lethal! Thats because my venom is the most potent of any Indian snake! You can identify me by the thin white bands on my black hide. Other non-venomous species like this Wolf Snake may resemble me, but best to keep away from us ALL. Wow. Youre the worst alarm clock ever invented, Krait! In my search for other snakes, rodents and lizards to eat, I crawl close to people sleeping outdoors without a mosquito net or on the floor. When they move or roll over in their sleep, I bite in self-defence. 4. Russells Viper Im the grumpiest of the big four. I like my personal space. A lot. If disturbed, I can get REALLY cranky! Im often mistaken for non-venomous Boas and Pythons, and handled, and thats a fatal mistake. Remember, if you see a chain-like pattern of markings on a snakes back, its me. This is an Indian Rock Python. Keep away. This is a Common Sand Boa. Keep away. This is me. Turn around and go home. I sit hidden in bushes, camouflaged in leaf litter, waiting for my prey to come to me. This can be dangerous for people walking in the dark without a torch. Avoiding this guy should be easy, right? You kids dont like to hang around grumpy old uncles anyway! You snakes arent as bad as we thought! You seem like a fun bunch, if we keep our distance... But how exactly do we keep a safe distance from snakes? Avoiding us is easy. You just need to take these simple precautions. 1. When working in open fields or playing in open areas, watch where you place your hands and feet. Probing with a long stick can easily detect our presence. 2. Always use a torch at night when you walk outdoors, even near your home. 3. If your regular path is littered with leaves, clear the litter with a rake. 4. Clean your homes, kitchens and storehouses regularly to keep them rat-free. 5. When sleeping outdoors or on the floor, create a physical barrier around you with the help of a well tucked-in mosquito net. Four rewards: no mosquito bites, no scorpion stings, no krait bites, and you get to snore away happily until morning! Rarely, snakebite accidents can happen despite taking the best precautions. You need to remember to take these steps. Do not take the victim to a tantrik or a snake charmer for treatment Do not suck the wound Do not cut the wound open Do not tie ligatures around the wound Do not burn the wound Do not apply herbal pastes over the wound Immobilise the affected limb Rush the victim to the nearest hospital that can deliver Anti-Snake Venom and emergency care I hope it never comes to that because I think you creatures are quite beautiful. And play an important role in nature and our lives! Aww, thank you! Ill remember to help my mother clean the kitchen after every meal, so that rats dont visit my house for scraps. Ill remember to tell my parents to buy a torch immediately so that they return safely from the fields every evening. And Ill remember to tell Uncle to use the mosquito net. He loves to sleep outdoors and wake the whole village up with his snoring! Thats the spirit, kids! While youre at it, dont forget to thank us for all the rats we eat, each time you burp after a bowl of curd rice! Hahahaha! Madras Crocodile Bank Have you ever been to the Madras Crocodile Bank? Its a reptile zoo in Chennai, which works for the conservation of reptiles. Its project Snake Conservation and Snakebite Mitigation teaches people about the importance of identifying which snakes are venomous, how to avoid them, and using antivenom serum.

Our tree is gone, we have no home, they sobbed. You need a bird who can peck wood to make a tree hole. Why dont you ask the woodpecker to make you a new home? said the crow. So Killi and Killan set off to find the woodpecker. Tiu Tiu . Killi and Killan heard a loud sound from the bushes below. Are you the woodpecker? Can you make us a new tree hole? they asked. No, Im the tailorbird . I stitch leaves together to make my nest. Pleased-to-meet-you! Killi and Killan heard a fluty whistle in the trees below. Are you the woodpecker?

Lets try a little longer. Toktok-toktok ! Killi and Killan saw a bird hammering at a tree branch. Are you the woodpecker? Can you make us a new tree hole? they asked. Yes, I am, said the woodpecker , but I'm busy making my own nest. You'll have to ask someone else. The parakeets looked at each other in despair. Tuk..tuk..tuk !

But what they have in common is that theyre all microbes, tiny creatures that live all around us. From deep under the earth to far up in the sky, microbes are everywhere. They live in the freezing cold and in the bubbling heat. They live in food, waste, rocks, trees, soil, and even you and me. So how many microbes live around us? A drop of water from a pond will have hundreds and hundreds of these tiny creatures! But to look at them, well need to use a microscope. A microscope is a device used to enlarge very small things that cant be seen with the naked eye. Lets take a closer look! Hydras can grow back their lost body parts and almost never die of old age. If you cut a planaria into two, each piece will develop into an individual planaria. Euglenas, like plants, can make their own food through photosynthesis. Diatoms produce 25 to 40 percent of the air we breathe. Amoebas can change their shapes. Sometimes, they do this to trap food. A single copepod can eat thousands of diatoms in just 24 hours. Tardigrades can survive in the most extreme conditions, like inside a volcano or in outer space. Paramecia swim really fast and can cover a distance of four times their length in a second. Cyanobacteria have been around for a very long time and have been found in fossils that are over a billion years old.'}"

Next, he watched one of a volcano spewing lava. Then, he watched one of a baby playing with a dog. With each video, Kunals face came closer and closer to the screen. Suddenly SCHWOOOOOP! Kunal was sucked into the Internet. Where am I? Kunal had landed on a platform in a strange train station. All around him, trains whooshed in and out through tunnels. A sign popped up above his head. It read Core Router. Core Router How did I get here? Kunal wondered. And how will I get out? Then Kunal saw a woman on the platform. She looked very busy directing the trains. Excuse me, aunty. Where are all these trains going? Kunal asked her. Im Transmission Control Protocol, she said, busily, But you can call me TCP. These trains are taking data to different parts of the Internet. Kunal watched TCP as her hands swiftly moved things around on a large screen. Wow, Kunal said. What are you doing, TCP Aunty? Im routing data through the Internet, of course, replied TCP. Everything has to go fast, fast, fast! The trains whooshed away, carrying data in every direction. Are all the phones and computers on the Internet connected? asked Kunal, an idea forming in his mind. Yes, said TCP Aunty, All the devices on the Internet are connected. These tunnels are actually wires, cables, radio waves and satellites in space. TCP Aunty, if all the devices on the Internet are connected, can you help me get back home? Of course! TCP said. She looked Kunal up and down. Well send you by packet switching. First, well break you into a few thousand pieces. Then well send all your bits by different paths and put you back together later. No! Kunal said, hurriedly. Is Isnt there another way? Hmmm, TCP frowned. Sending you all together by circuit switching is a lot less efficient. But if you insist. Now lets ask your mother for your address. But I know my address, Kunal said, confused. Not your home address, replied TCP. Your Internet address! She opened up a chat window in the air and quickly explained everything to Kunals mother. We host a website on my computerKunalBabyPictures.com. Can you find that? said Mummy. We can find your Mummys computer using the Internet Protocol or IP, TCP said. Every computer and website on the Internet has a unique number called an IP address. TCP opened a big book with DNS written on the cover. This book contains the IP address of every website on the Internet, she told Kunal. She looked through it carefully until Found it! Here, said TCP. Youll need to be encrypted so that nobody else can grab you on the way. TCP handed Kunal a hat and silly glasses with a nose and moustache attached. Youre very sensitive data indeed! she said. Goodbye, TCP Aunty! Kunal replied, cheerfully. Kunal was moving fast, very fast. His arms and legs tingled. And thenPOP! He was back home. My dear! Mummy said. Its good to have you back. Next time, learn about the Internet by reading about it, not getting lost inside it. Kunal loved the Internet, but he loved being home even more. What is the Internet? The Internet is the name for all the different computers, phones and tablets that are connected to each other. It is a system that is spread across the entire world. It lets us transfer data from one computer to another through copper wires, fibre-optic cables, radio transmissions and satellites in space. Every device that is connected to the Internet has a unique number called an IP address. How Does Data Travel? Many kinds of data are sent through the Internet, such as emails, web pages, videos, chats and pictures. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a set of rules and procedures used by computers to transfer data by first breaking it into chunks called packets. Then the packets are put back together again (in the right order!) when they reach their destination. This method of data transfer is called packet switching. In circuit switching, the entire data is sent through a single path. This is a less efficient method than packet switching.'}"

So Amma takes Abel to meet Postmaster Wilson. Wilson Uncle! Abel cries, What if Ammachi doesnt get my card, because of my handwriting? Dont worry, Postmaster Wilson says. All the letters are sorted by our robot RIA. RIA reads the address, identifies the postal code and sorts each postal code into the correct pile. But Abel is still worried. Uncle, please see if RIA has sorted my card correctly. Postmaster Wilson looks for the letter and finds it in the right box. Amma looks at the card. Abels 7 looks like a 1. Then how did it land in the right box? Abel is surprised. RIA sorted your card correctly because it learned by looking at the handwriting of millions of people, says Postmaster Wilson. That is why it could understand your 7 even though it looked like a 1. RIA is so smart! says Abel. Its because RIA keeps learning from numerous examples every day. This is called Machine Learning, the Postmaster says. So will Ammachi get her card? Dont worry, Abel. She will get her card by New Years Eve, Postmaster Wilson replies. Postmaster Wilson is right! Ammachi gets the card on New Years Day. When she calls Abel, he tells her all about their adventures with the amazing robot at the post office. What is Machine Learning? When we are born, there are very few things we know how to do. As we grow up, we learn new things. Like us, computers can learn through experience, and learn to do a task without being told how to do it. For example, if we want a computer to tell the difference between a cow and a cat, it needs to be shown thousands of pictures of cats and cows. The computer will study the pictures and soon work out for itself that cats are small and cows are large, or that cats have shorter noses than cows. The more pictures of cows and cats a computer studies, the fewer mistakes it makes telling them apart. This book is a work of fiction. Though the technology depicted in the book exists, the characters, situations, and events are entirely made up.'}"

Kindly do the needful and please return the robot to him. Thanking you, Yours respectfully, Andys mother P.S. This letter was not written by another robot or by Andy, but by me. Bittu Bottu was allowed to go home with Andy that day. Now Andy did the housework himself. He did his lab work himself. Andy even did his homework himself... But not always. Bittu Bottu is made of four basic parts. 1. Power Supply Robots need electricity to do work. Bittu Bottu has a rechargeable battery inside and solar powered cells outside. Diodes, resistors, transistors and capacitors control the power as needed. 2. Actuators Actuators are motors that use power to help the robot move. Big motors help Bittu Bottu move from place to place. Little motors move his head and arms. 3. Sensors Sensors allow a robot to see and hear. Bittu Bottus sensors are cameras and microphones that work as his eyes and ears. 4. Controller The controller is the brain of a robot. It understands the information from the sensors and tells the actuators what to do. It can be programmed to follow human commands. A controller is usually made of integrated circuits (ICs).'}"

Thats the planet Mars. Ever since humans invented telescopes, theyve looked at Mars and wondered: what is it like on Mars? Is there life up there? We can look at Mars from down here and try to guess. But what if we could actually travel there? Mars is one of the nearest planets to Earth in the solar system. And yet it is so far away that if you were to drive to it, it would take 1,200 years to get there. In an aeroplane, even at top speed, it would take 30 years. Take a look at this. If the Earth were this big the Moon would be around here. And Mars would be somewhere over there, half a kilometre away. Cars and aeroplanes cannot take us there. To go to Mars, we need spaceships. On November 5, 2013, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launched a spaceship that would travel to Mars. It was called Mangalyaan. Mangalyaan carried no humans on it. Instead, it carried four instruments, including one powerful camera with which to look at Mars from up close. Mangalyaan The first challenge facing Mangalyaan was the huge distance to be travelled. Flying straight to Mars would require a lot of fuel. And fuel is expensive. So the scientists of ISRO tried a more creative solution. They decided to throw Mangalyaan towards Mars, as if from a sling. Only in this case, Earths gravity played the role of the sling. Mangalyaan first started to orbit Earth. Then, it was put into bigger and bigger orbits by firing the engines six times. Each time, it picked up more speed. When Mangalyaan was at its fastest, it was given one final push. With that, it escaped Earths gravity. Since Earth also moves in orbit around the Sun, its speed was added to Mangalyaans. Earth, in other words, acted like the hand throwing the slingshot. But Mangalyaan didnt fly straight to Mars. This is because Mars itself moves in orbit around the Sun. The scientists had to aim far ahead, so that Mangalyaan and Mars would both reach the same point in space at exactly the same time. 1. Mars was over here when Mangalyaan was launched 2. Mangalyaans path to Mars 3. Mangalyaan caught Mars over here 10 months later 4. Earth moves in orbit around the Sun 5. Mars moves in orbit around the Sun Its a long, long way to Mars. Mangalyaan travelled for 300 days and covered 62,00,00,000 km. Over such a long journey, it was very important that the spaceship stay on the right track. Otherwise, it could easily miss Mars. Mangalyaan could tell where it was by the position of the stars around it. It sent this information back to Mission Control on Earth. Here, mathematicians checked to see whether the spaceship was still on the right path. When needed, they sent signals to the spaceship telling it to fire its engines and correct its path. 1. Dish to talk to Earth 2. Fuel tank 3. Solar panel to power the ship's electronics After many months in space, Mangalyaan was almost there. With just a few days to go, Mars gravity started pulling the spaceship in. As the spaceship neared the red planet, it had to slow down to enter into orbit. This had to be done very carefully, otherwise it could crash into Mars or fly away forever. It was a tense moment for everyone. However, on September 24, 2014, perfect entry into Mars orbit was achieved. Even today, Mangalyaan continues to orbit Mars and send pictures back to Earth. This is an actual photograph taken by Mangalyaan. We still dont know for certain whether there is, or ever was, life on Mars. But isnt it amazing that we could reach a destination so far out there? Now we can dream of sending people up there too. In fact, ISRO is already building a new spaceship that will take humans into space. It is called Gaganyaan. Gaganyaan will take three people on board and is set to take off in a few years. Would you like to be on it? What Is Gravity? It is the force that pulls all objects to each other. The Moon and Earth pull each other. So do the Sun and Earth. However, the heavier an object is, the greater its gravity. This is why small things, like this stone, fall to the ground. The much heavier Earth pulls the stone to itself with its high gravity. The stone also pulls Earth to itself but the stones gravity is so small that Earth moves only a very, very tiny amount that is not noticeable. What Is an Orbit? When I throw the stone, Earths gravity still pulls it, but the stone travels a bit before falling to the ground. When I throw it harder, it travels farther before falling. But what if I could throw it really, really hard? At just the right speed, the stone will travel all the way around Earth and keep going. It will have entered into orbit. In this exact manner, Mangalyaan was placed in orbit first around Earth and then around Mars. In space, lighter objects orbit around heavier objects due to gravity, like the Moon around Earth and Earth around the Sun. Orbits are generally elliptical (oval) in shape.""}"

The shortcut takes them past a piece of land that has stood vacant for years. But today, it is buzzing with activity. Lets take the shortcut, Meenu akka! Gurra-gurra-gurra! A huge vehicle moves back and forth, slowly scooping out clumps of bushes, grass and rocks. GURRA GURRA GURRA Look, Mani mama is driving the bulldozer! says Meenu. The children wave at Mani mama, the site supervisor. He waves back. Tea break! Mani mama's voice booms across the site. GURRA GURRA GURRA Whats going on here, Mani mama? asks Elango. We are building a new school for you, says Mani mama, wiping his sweaty face. Yay! Elango jumps with excitement. Our old asbestos roof leaks when it rains. And during the summer, our classrooms get so hot! When will the school be ready? asks Meenu. It will take nearly a year, says Mani mama. We are clearing and levelling the site now. Off you go, theres too much dust in the air! Every afternoon, Meenu and Elango pass the site and watch the men and women at work. One day, they notice a woman looking at some charts. This is Radhika akka, our civil engineer, says Mani mama. Would you like to see our floor plan? asks Radhika akka. Whats a floor plan? asks Elango. Its a drawing that shows the design of the building. You can see where each room is, and where the windows and doors will be, explains Radhika akka. That big rectangle, is that the library? asks Meenu. Yes, a library with books and computers! A week later, Elango and Meenu see a big vehicle digging deep, square-shaped holes. Look at that giant robot scooping out mud, yells Meenu. Thats an excavator, says Mani mama. Today, we will start working on the foundation. Its the base that supports the weight of the building. By the first week of August, more holes have been dug. Cartloads of long steel rods have arrived. Meenu and Elango watch benders bind the rods to make steel frames and a lot of noise. Clang, clang, clang! Gada, gada, gada goes the cement mixer. It is mixing cement, sand, gravel and water to form concrete, says Mani mama. GADA GADA GADA CLANG CLANG The children watch as steel frames are lowered into each hole. Look, they are pouring concrete around the base of the steel frame. The concrete becomes hard once it dries and this forms the foundation below the ground, says Radhika akka. On a sunny morning, Meenu and Elango watch the workers set up wooden planks along the sides of the steel frames. The planks form a casing around the steel frames. Concrete is poured into these wooden casings. Once the concrete hardens, the wooden planks are removed and the pillars are ready, says Radhika akka. Oh, its like the moulds used to make ice lollies! Elango exclaims. You pour the juice into a mould, leave it in ice until it hardens and then remove the mould. Exactly! says Mani mama. Now lets get some ice lollies! By October, the first slab is ready and the pillars have been raised to roof level. The brickwork starts in November. Meenu and Elango watch the masons place brick upon brick. The masons slap the cement over the bricks. Splat, splat, splat! Then, they smoothen the surface with trowels. As the walls of the building come up, the rain comes down. I hope it stops pouring soon! We need to finish the brickwork in a month, says Mani mama. On their next visit to the site, Elango asks Mani mama, Is that the roof coming up? Yes, but be careful! says Mani mama. The workers are connecting the pillars using beams. They will set up metal plates underneath, fix steel rods over them and pour concrete over that. Once it sets, the plates will be removed and the roof will be ready. How does the roof stay up until the concrete hardens? asks Meenu. See those wooden poles? They hold up the metal plates from below until the concrete sets, says Radhika akka. By the end of March, the roof is complete. While Meenu and Elango write their final exams, the carpenters fit the windows and doors. The electricians wire the building. The plumbers install pipes for drinking water and drainage. The workers paint the building and install lights, fans, switches, bolts and locks. When school reopens in June, the smell of fresh paint still hangs in the air. Brand new fans, brand new benches and a brand new blackboard! cries Elango. Same old Bhaskar Master! chuckles his science teacher.""}"

If people jump into one and travel back far enough, they will be able to witness history come alive. No two rivers are alike. Their moods change depending on what time of year it is and which part of the country theyre travelling through. Some rivers are peaceful in the winter. Some rivers are small and shy in the summer. Some rivers roar angrily in the monsoons. A river may be brown, grey, black, blue, green or several other shades. They change their colour based on whats inside them or whats around them. Sometimes they are the colour of the rocks at the bottom of the river. Sometimes they match the colour of the sky. Rivers also change their course. If a river is in one spot in the past, it may be somewhere else in the future. Many rivers like the Ganga are thousands of years old. They have seen humankind grow up. People have always loved living and working near rivers. Rivers know how to take care of people. Some of our food comes from rivers and river water is used to grow most food. When the food has made its way through the body, rivers to the rescue again! If rivers could speak, they might demand people dump their poop somewhere else. Humans arent the only creatures rivers look after. Many birds and plants, animals and fishes, insects and flowers rely on rivers. Rivers even support musical talent. Insects sing strange and wonderful songs underwater which sound like theyre from another world. India gets its name from a river. Apart from naming the country, the Indus was home to one of the oldest civilisations in the world. The river helped the ancient people build cities. They used the river to travel to lands both near and far, carrying everything they wanted to buy and sell. The Indus Valley citizens lived beside the river quite happily. Until suddenly they didnt. More than 3,000 years ago, the civilisation vanished. Some people think they got a bit too greedy. That by overusing the forest and water, they made the river flood. Floods are scary but sometimes they are useful. When floodwaters return to the river, they leave behind rich soil on the banksperfect for growing crops! But floods can also destroy lives and buildings. Furious rivers frighten people. Ancient humans thought songs, prayers and gifts could calm the river down. It wasnt usually the best plan. Travel on the river time machine back to the present. Some things from the past will seem familiar. Rivers continue to be used for food and transport. People have also built canals to connect rivers, carry water to those who dont live near rivers, and to make it easy to travel on them. People construct dams to control the flow of rivers, store water, and create electricity from the rivers energy. But all this human meddling is messing up the rivers. Dams and canals make it harder for rivers to take care of all their creatures. Many people dont understand how rivers work, how rivers live and how rivers die. In some areas, rivers have become as dry as deserts. In others, rivers are treated like rubbish bins, sewage pipes, and plastic dumps. If the river time machine takes people on a trip into the future, what will they see? A scene of empty rivers which live only in old stories. They will find states and countries at war over the few rivers which do exist. They will wander into a barren wasteland. Or they will see a world in which humans have learned to live with nature and with each other. A world where fresh water is stored, waste water is recycled, and both are used responsibly. They will find clean rivers and people who protect them. The second future isnt impossible. Our skills and technology have brought dead rivers back to life before. Rivers have taken care of us for thousands of years. Now some humans are trying to take care of our rivers. Some courts have decided that rivers have the same legal rights humans do. If someone damages a river, itll be like harming another person. Imagine the long list of complaints a river will have against people! GUILTY! Children are taking to the streets to demand a better future. In 2015, 11-year-old Stella Bowles campaigned her local government to fix the polluted riverand they did! Adults are beginning to listen. This river is contaminated with fecal bacteria! All across the globe, children are telling adults that they need to do a better job of looking after the world theyre leaving behind. Its the only one we have, after all. AMAZON sea levels rising! Climate Strike The work of cleaning rivers never ends. There will be more humans, more farms, more factories. Luckily, there is enough water for everyone. We just need to look after it and after each other.'}"

And theyre all the same shape Why did the bees choose this shape? Why not a circle? Pranav wonders. He imagines the hive in circles. That would not work. Bees are very clever, Pranav tells his friends the next day. He has been reading all about them. They have discovered the best shape for their home. Hexagons come together with no holes or gaps, just like a jigsaw puzzle. Their maths teacher, Mr Das, overhears them. The six sides of the hexagon provide more room for the bees, he adds. Where did they learn how to do that? asks Pranav. Mr Das says, with a smile, Patterns are everywhere! At the market the next day, Pranav looks carefully at the fruits and vegetables. He looks at the pineapples, ridge gourds and the insides of oranges. So many sizes, colours, shapes... but Pranav can see the patterns! Are patterns really everywhere? he wonders. Pranav becomes a pattern detective! There are so many things in nature that are created using repeating patterns, Pranav tells his class the next day. We use repeating patterns in our man-made world as well, says Mr Das. Why dont you try to create something using a pattern? That can be your homework. What shapes shall we use to make the pattern? Pranav asks. Mr Das writes the answer on the blackboard. Use any shape you want. At home, Pranav thinks about his homework. He imagines making his own hive, perhaps with squares. Or triangles. He thinks about what Mr Das said. Patterns are everywhere. Then, he starts seeing the patterns. Carpet. Bookshelf. Windows. Patterns everywhere! Wherever he looks, he sees shapes coming together. Bees are not the only clever ones, Pranav thinks. We use shapes and patterns for so many things! And so Pranav gets busy drawing his dream house. Red rectangular bricks.

Spot the Patterns Nature has clever ways of taking shapes and putting them together. Pranav sees this in the world around him: the outside of a pineapple, the inside of an orange, the hexagons of a beehive. Some shapes, like hexagons and squares, fit together perfectly, leaving no gaps. But others, like circles, dont. When shapes in nature fit together in repeating patterns, leaving no gaps or holes, it is called tessellation. Pranav sees that humans also use tessellation . We repeat shapes to form patterns, and use these patterns to design bookshelves, build castles and create works of art. A simpler word for tessellation is tiling .'}"

Your plant is so beautiful, Shruthi! her classmate said. Shruthi was prouder than ever. How did Shruthi grow her plant in water? Shruthi grew her plant using hydroponics. Hydroponics is the method of growing plants in water. Plants need air, water, sunlight and nutrients (salts and minerals) to grow. When they are planted in the ground, they gather their nutrients from the soil. But when plants are grown in water, nutrients have to be fed to them.

This energy allows them to use their muscles to fly. Unlike us humans, Loten and Lily cannot store much energy in their bodies as fat. They have to stay very light. Otherwise, they will not be able to fly. This is why sunbirds have to eat many times a day. In fact, they spend most of their days flying around, looking for food.

Would you like to see where I work? Welcome to my lab! Yuck! Whats that smell? Ugh! This orange has been sitting on my friend Tashis desk for a week now. See how its covered in green fuzz? Thats fungus. Shall we take a closer look? Lets use a microscope. It helps us see things that our eyes arent powerful enough to see on their own. I know they look scary but some microbes can be very helpful. For instance, this fungus tells us that the orange is spoiled and that we shouldnt eat it. Did you know that there are microbes that can eat plastic? They could help solve plastic pollution! Not all microbes are friendly though. Some types of the bacteria E.coli can cause tummy aches. But if we get to know them better and understand why they make us sick, we can try to prevent illnesses. Thats why I study how E.coli cells react to changes in their environment. I use some very cool tools to do this. Microscope: an instrument which makes really small objects look bigger by magnifying them. Petri Dish: a circular, transparent dish with a flat lid used to maintain microbes in certain conditions. Pipette: a slender tube with a bulb at one end used for transferring or measuring small quantities of liquid. Autoclave: a strong heated container that uses high pressure and temperature for chemical reactions and other processes. Lets ask Tashi if hes seen my petri dish. And tell him to throw away that orange! Hi Tashi! Tashi was my first friend at university. When I first came here to study, I felt lost. I didnt speak much English and all my classes were hard. Plus, everyone else seemed so smart and I just couldnt keep up. I wanted to give up so many times and just go home, but how could I? I'm the first woman in my family to go to college and they supported me every step of the way. I didnt want to let them or myself down. Besides, I loved exploring this invisible world around me. So I kept trying. Learning to not give up is important, especially when youre a microbiologist. Because a lot of the experiments I do fail. What keeps me going is when things work. Its so exciting when youve learned something that no one else knows yet! But even when things dont work out, its alright. It helps me ask the next question. Like, Where is my petri dish? Tashi hasnt seen it either. I need to do the experiment again. Will you keep me company? Im going to take some E.coli, grow it in a conical flask and see what happens when I dont give it enough to eat. Ill take another E.coli sample in a second flask and give it food. Then Ill wait and see what happens to the number of E.coli in both these flasks. This is called making an observation. After the experiment is completed, Ill compare the E.coli growth in both the flasks and write down my observations. These are the results of my experiment. It will help me answer the question: Does the amount of food affect the growth of E.coli? What I learn from the results is called an inference. A typical E.coli growth experiment takes 10 to 12 hours to complete. Since I dont need to sit here and watch the cells the entire time, I read about new discoveries, attend meetings and talk to other scientists about their work. This is important because I learn exciting new things from them and often get ideas for my own work. Sometimes, we also just sit around, have tea and chat! Scientists may seem very serious, but really, were just like you and your friends. We like to play hockey, sing in the shower and read scary stories! We are also curious about the world around us. We like to ask questions constantly: Why? Why not? How? What if? Were like detectives who look for clues that help answer all these fascinating questions. Even if theyre inside your stomach. Speaking of which, Im hungry. Lets eat! Tashi! Grow your own mould! The fungus that grows on old food is called mould. To grow your own mould, take a piece of leftover roti or a slice of stale bread, sprinkle it with water, place it on a plate and cover it with a clear glass bowl. Keep at room temperature and out of direct sunlight for two days. Check the food and see if white, blue, green or gray fuzz has appeared on it. Leave it alone for 2 more days and then check on it. How does the mould look now? Make a note. Repeat this every 2 days until day 10. What do you think will happen? The water and room temperature create the perfect conditions for growing mould! The mould will look different on different items of food. That is because different kinds of mould spores like some foods better than others. At the end of 10 days, carefully dispose of the mouldy food with the help of your teacher. Maybe you could add it to a compost pit!""}"

One feather floated down. Blue and indigo! Manasa punched the air in delight. YES! Green was easy. Parakeets sat on the banyan tree every day SQUAWKing over the red berries. Manasa found a long green feather on the ground. The edges were yellow. Whats left? Orange and red! Manasa said. Four hours and only two colours left. I can do it! After lunch, Manasa decided to look for a red feather. That bulbul is always hanging around the house, she said. And it has red feathers. The bulbul was there, but there were no feathers. It was evening. Titus would be there soon, and the bulbul was still on the branch. Pleeeease, Manasa begged it. Just one feather from under your tail! Manasa sulked, Titus will make fun of me for ever! SWOOSH, two sunbirds swooped in. They dipped their beaks in the hibiscus flowers for nectar and flew away. Two feathers landed on Manasas head: a yellow feather and an orangey-red one. Yes! Manasa shouted. When Titus got there, Manasa said proudly, See? Every colour! No pink! Titus whined, ignoring Manasas beautiful feather rainbow. No white! Wheres brown? You just needed one sparrow. Aaaaaaargh! Manasa screamed. Amma, help!'}"

There were reptiles that lived on land, swam in the sea, burrowed under the ground, and even flew through the skies. There were dinosaurs that were taller than buildings, shorter than stools, bigger than construction cranes, and smaller than ducks. They came in all shapes and sizes, just like humans! The Ornithomimus was the fastest dinosaur. It could run as fast as a scooter! The Hadrosaur was the dinosaur with the most teeth. It had more than a thousand! The Pentaceratops was the dinosaur with the biggest head. Its skull was bigger than a refrigerator! The Quetzalcoatlus was the biggest flying reptile. The distance from the tip of one wing to the other was longer than a telephone pole! The Micropachycephalosaurus was the dinosaur with the longest name, but it was very small no bigger than a 4-year-old human! The Therizinosaurus had the longest claws. Each claw was half as long as a bed! The Argentinosaurus was one of the largest dinosaurs. It was larger than a cricket pitch! The Shuvuuia was one of the smallest dinosaurs. It was the size of a hen! So, where are all the dinosaurs now? Dinosaurs disappeared millions of years ago. No human has ever seen one. All thats left of them are fossils, which are often buried deep underground. Scientists are still searching for fossils to learn more about these amazing creatures. Dinosaurs existed for 175 million years until Earth was struck by a meteor 65 million years ago, which slowly killed all the dinosaurs. When the first dinosaur bone or fossil was discovered in 1677, scientists thought it was from a giant man! By the 1800s, scientists began to realise that they belonged to a different species that no longer existed. They called them dinosaurs which means terrible lizards in Greek. Palaeontology, the study of animal and plant fossils, soon became popular. Palaeontologists have discovered around 700 species of dinosaurs, and are still finding more. Dinosaur fossils are most commonly found in China, South America and North America. Do you want to see a dinosaur? Then look around you. Many scientists believe that birds are descendants of dinosaurs. Those terrible lizards are still among us!'}"

He is sleeping. To know him well, like I do, you have to use your ears more than your eyes. You have to listen to Appa and his sounds carefully. Hhh hgh ghh hhh When Appa sleeps, he breathes quietly. Like wind through leaves. I can make that sound by cupping my hands over my mouth and blowing gently. Hhho-hhha-hhho-hhha. But sometimes, Appa snores as loud as thunder. I can snore like Appa by grunting through my nose like a pig and then flapping my lips like a horse. Kroaa-tbphpht-kroaa-tbphpht. Hhho - hhha - hhho - hhha Kroaa -tbphpht Kroaa -tbphpht When Appa wakes up, he scratches his arms and legs. I can make this sound by tearing paper into small pieces. Krrrsk-krrrsk-krrrsk-krrrsk. When Appa stands up, the bones in his legs pop and crackle. Like cloth flapping in the wind. I clap with two fingers to make this sound. Khat-khat-khat-khat Krrrsk-krrrsk Krrrsk-krrrsk Khat -khat -khat -khat Appa chews loudly with his mouth open. I stomp through slush after the rains to make this sound. Squish-squash-squelch-squalch. When Appa eats something hard, it makes a breaking, crushing sound. I step on dry leaves and twigs to make this sound. Karak-muruk-katak-latak. Squish-squash squelch-squalch Karak - muruk katak - latak When Appa drinks water, the ball in his throat rises and falls. It makes a deep, muffled sound. When I go swimming and my ears get blocked, everything sounds like Appa's drinking sound. Guduk-guduk-guduk. Guduk Guduk Guduk After lunch, Appa burps from his mouth. This means the food was good. Appa's burps sound like slow lorries going up a hilly road. Rrraaahhhrrrhhh! If Appa burps from his bum, then his stomach did not like the food. His bum burps are musical. I pull my cheeks back tightly and blow while keeping my mouth closed. Pheeeooooowoink! Rrra aahh hrrr hhh! Pheeeoo ooowoink! If Appa's nose whistles, it means that he is getting a cold. He sometimes takes a sharp breath to clear his nose. When I drag a chair on the floor, it makes the same sound. Tststszszstztz! When Appa is fully sick, his nose gets fully blocked. He then has to pant from his mouth, like me when I run very fast. Hhhun-hhhun-hhhun. Hhhun- hhhun- hhhun Tststszszstztz! Appa has a large, loud laugh that can be heard three houses away. I roar like a hungry tiger-monkey to laugh like Appa. HROAHAHAHA! HROAHAHAHA! My favourite Appa sound is one he can't make alone. He needs me to make that sound. It's when he kisses my forehead with a loud, wet smack. MMMPPTZTZCHUAH! MMM PPT ZTZCH UAH! How do ears hear sound? Sound waves travel into the ear canal until they reach the eardrum. The eardrum passes the vibrations of the sound waves through the middle ear into the inner ear. The inner ear is shaped like a snail and is called the cochlea. Finally, the sound waves reach the cochlea which contains thousands of tiny hair cells that can sense sound. Sometimes the hair cells inside the cochlea get damaged and people may not be able to hear well. This can happen because of old age, injury or illness. A hearing aid is a small electronic device that can help such people hear better. Inner Ear Outer Ear Middle Ear Ear Canal Ear Drum How does a hearing aid work? A hearing aid is worn in or behind the ear. It makes sounds louder using three basic parts: a microphone, an amplifier and a speaker. 1. Sound enters the hearing aid through the microphone. 2. The microphone passes on the sound to the amplifier, which increases its power and makes it louder. 3. These amplified sounds are then sent to the ear through the speaker. Do you know of somebody who could benefit from using a hearing aid? Take them to your local ENT (ear nose throat) doctor for a checkup.

Woaaaaah eee ee ooo woooah rrr aaah! Whats that sound? Its whales, singing in the distance strong, loud and melodious! Whales sing short and long songs. Some songs last just a few minutes. Some songs can go on for half an hour. Whales can also sing the same song for hours on end. There are many kinds of whales. Blue Whales and Grey Whales are named after colours. Humpback Whales and Bowhead Whales are named after the shapes of their backs and heads. Omuras Whales and Brydes Whales are named after people. Omuras whale is named after Hideo Omura, a whale biologist. Brydes whale is named after Johan Bryde, a whaling businessman. Songs vary between different species of whales. A Blue Whale will sing a different song from a Fin Whale, just like humans speak different languages. Humpback whales are excellent composers. They mix and match notes together. If you listen carefully, you can tell that each song is made up of patterns of several notes. Blue whales sing much simpler songs. Their songs consist of just a note or two. But they make up for it by being very loud! Blue Whales can be heard over 1,000 km away. Imagine a friend singing in Bengaluru and you being able to hear them in Mumbai! Bengaluru Mumbai Bowhead Whales that live in the cold Arctic ocean are also musicians. All through winter, during days and nights of complete darkness, Bowhead Whales sing their songs under the frozen surface of the sea. Not just one song, but many different ones. Fin Whale songs are so low-pitched that humans can't hear them. Scientists place specially built microphones and recorders in the ocean to hear them! Why do whales sing? As far as we know, only male whales sing. Scientists think that it is to impress female whales or tell each other, Look what a powerful voice I have, this means that I am bigger and stronger than you! We may not understand what these songs mean, but we do know that they are beautiful to listen to.""}"

Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of a living organism, plant or animal. They tell us what life on Earth was like hundreds, thousands or even millions of years ago! This is the fossil of a creature called an ammonite. Ammonites were squid-like creatures that lived in the sea 400 million to 65 million years ago. Paleontologists and archaeologists are scientists who dig up the ground to find fossils. When they dug in the Himalayas, they found lots of ammonites. But how did the fossils of sea creatures end up on the tallest mountains in the world? To answer this question, we have to go back a hundred million years, when the Earth was quite different. Back then, Earth had only two enormous continents: Gondwanaland and Laurasia. Between them was the gigantic Tethys Sea. LAURASIA GONDWANALAND THE TETHYS SEA Just beneath the surface of the continents and the sea sits a layer of Earth called the outer crust. This outer crust is made of very large moving pieces called plates. Earths plates are almost 100 kilometres thick and made of solid rock. But underneath is a layer of molten rock that allows the plates on top to move really slowly. OUTER CRUST TECTONIC PLATES MOLTEN LAVA As the plates moved, the two supercontinents began to break apart into smaller and smaller pieces. LAURASIA GONDWANALAND TRIASSIC PERIOD JURASSIC PERIOD All of the pieces began moving, each off on its own journey. We will now follow the journey of two plates in particular. NORTH AMERICA SOUTH AMERICA ANTARCTICA EURASIA AFRICA INDIA AUSTRALIA CRETACEOUS PERIOD The Indian plate was a fast-moving plate. It moved closer and closer to the Eurasian plate until... ...BAM! It collided right into it! This collision was so powerful that it caused the bed of the Tethys Sea to rise up, sea creatures and all, and form the Himalayas. How do we know all this? Well, remember the ammonites? Until the fossils of these sea creatures were discovered, we didnt know for sure that plates were under the continents and oceans, moving about. EURASIAN PLATE INDIAN PLATE And you know what? The plates are still there, beneath our feet, moving very, very slowly. (Except for when they move suddenly, which causes big earthquakes!)'}"

The jewel slipped out of his fist and shattered into many pieces. The light from that jewel held the door open, the statue said. The jewel will take years to grow back. Now you can never leave. Arun looked at the broken jewel in panic. There must be some other way. There is one other way, but you must hurry. The statue closed its eyes. Wake up! Arun punched the statues chest, scattering centuries of dust into the air. Look, Arunachalam, theres a note here! It says that to open the door, we have to complete the circuit. Heres what we need: The hair of a current creature to power the circuit, A hair clip from the resisters to control the current flow, A jewel from the upstairs place to emit light And feathers from a wirebird to connect everything together.

Arun cried. Three girls appeared out of nowhere and swatted the creatures nose. Arf-arf! The current creature lowered its tail and ran away. Thanks a lot! Arun said, to the girls. But why are you so tall? Er, they replied Why are you so short? I dont have time to waste, Arun rolled his eyes. I need to find the resisters. The girls laughed. We are the resisters. Oh! Arun smiled. Can I have your hair clip please? You can have it if you can reach it. Arun hopped and jumped and leaped. But he was still too short to reach their heads. Im sorry for calling you too tall! Arun said, out of breath. The sisters grinned and handed Arun one hair clip. He thanked them, and then asked, Is that the upstairs place? The upstairs place! You mustnt go there, said the resisters. The wirebird pecks anyone who goes there. A bird? Arun laughed, Im not afraid of a silly bird. Arun and Arunachalam climbed up to the jewels around the wirebirds nest. Arun grabbed a jewel but dropped it to catch a baby wirebird that had wandered too close to the edge. Ka kaaaaa! The mother wirebird swooped down and grabbed Arun by the shoulder. Put me down! Arun yelled, clutching a clump of the birds feathers. I was helping. The wirebird dropped him. Argh! I cant believe we lost the jewel! Arun said. Click click click Arunachalam grinned. The jewel in his mouth sparkled. They ran past the upstairs place, past the three resisters and past the current creature. At last they were in front of the statue. Arun pinned the jewel to the statues chest. He fixed the resisters hair clip under the jewel. He peeled out two wires from the wirebirds feather. He pinned one under the jewel and the other next to the hair clip. Why isnt the light turning on? Then, all at once, he remembered. He touched the hair of the current creature to the open wire. FLASH! It was the brightest light Arun had ever seen. The palace door swung open. We did it!

It has components such as a battery, resistors and LEDs that are connected by wires. Electronic circuits are built to do certain tasks, for example, the task of an LED circuit is to make the LED glow. To make your own LED circuit, you will need: 1. An LED (light emitting diode) An electronic component that produces light when current flows through it. 2. A resistor An electronic component used to reduce the flow of current. 3. Two wires Wires are metal threads covered with plastic, used to carry the electric current. 4. A nine-volt battery The component that supplies power to the circuit. 5. A breadboard A platform upon which to build the circuit. Build your own electronic circuit Note: Make sure you have an adult or teacher around when you are trying out this experiment. Step 1 Fix the LED to the breadboard. Step 2 Pin the resistor to the long leg of the LED. Step 3 Pin one wire next to the short leg of the LED and one wire right next to the resistor. Step 4 Connect the wire next to the short leg of the LED to the negative side of the battery. Step 5 Connect the wire next to the resistor to the positive side of the battery. Step 6 When the light turns on, your electronic circuit is complete!'}"

Our bodies are made up of tiny things called atoms. Atoms are everywhere! They are in animals and objects, in books, roads, oceans, the sun and the whole universe. Atoms come close together and then move far away from each other. This happens inside you, inside me and inside everyone and everything you know! Whizz! Whoosh! They are buzzing with energy. The same thing happens in space, where there are lots of gases and dust particles floating around. In some parts of the universe, lots of dust particles collect, forming a cloud. As the cloud grows, it becomes very heavy. All the atoms inside begin to fuse together. When the cloud becomes too heavy, SWOOOOSH, it collapses! Atoms come rushing to the center of the cloud and are squeezed so tight that they stick together and form bigger atoms. This releases heat and light. Any two Hydrogen and Helium atoms that fuse together release energy. When millions of atoms do this, a very hot, very bright, very big ball of energy is formed. And then a star is born! To us on Earth, stars may look tiny. But they are actually HUGE. Do you know which star is closest to us? The Sun! The Sun is big, bright and gives off a lot of light . All the other stars in the sky are also fiery balls like the Sun. Some of them are even bigger. But they are very FAR away. That is why they look tiny to us. If you start counting the stars in the sky, you will be counting all night. And the next night too! There are THAT many stars in the sky! And these are only the ones we can see. There are GAZILLIONS of stars in the universe! Young stars, old stars, big stars, little stars, hot stars, cool stars, and even colourful stars. There are Red Giants that glow big and red. There are White Dwarfs that are extremely hot. Stars can also be yellow or blue! Stars change colour as they grow older. The Sun is now yellow. As it grows older, it will become bigger and redder, expanding like a balloon. Then it will shrink, becoming white. Stars sometimes explode too! This is called a Supernova. This releases large amounts of dust, gas, and atoms everything that a star is made of! We wont be around to see the Sun change colour because stars live for billions and trillions of years. The Sun is a young star. Its only 4.6 billion years old. The oldest star we know is 13.2 billion years old. The universe is 13.8 billion years old. When it comes to stars and the universe, everything is very large. The Sun is so massive that more than a million Earths could fit inside it. The Earth is so enormous that billions of people can live on it. And we are all made of so many atoms that theyre impossible to count! The next time you go out during the day, remember how big and hot the Sun is. And at night, look up at the tiny twinkling stars and remember how large they really are. Compared to everything else in the universe, we are the small ones!'}"

Come and see the godavan. Rania stopped playing with her goat and ran to Saleem mamu. In the mung bean field was a big bird with a black crown. It was taller than her, but not as tall as Saleem mamu. Frrsht! The godavans tail feathers stood up straight. Poof! The godavans neck inflated like a balloon. Saleem Mamu smiled. We stopped putting pesticides in the field and so the godavan has come here to find a mate. He is showing off for her. The next week, Saleem Mamu took Rania for a walk. He pointed and said, Our godavans mate has laid an egg on the ground. We have to keep it safe from being trampled by the cows and goats and camels. Saleem Mamu told Rania to protect the nest but not go too close to it. Shoo! said Rania to the cows and goats. PHURRR, Rania scolded the camels. Youre safe, whispered Rania to the godavan and her egg. One night there was a terrible storm. Thunder boomed like a drum. Lightning flashed over the sand dunes. Rania wondered if the godavan and her egg were okay. In the morning, Rania went to check on the nest. Oh, no! she cried. The storm has destroyed the egg. Saleem Mamu laughed. He pointed to the pieces of eggshell on the ground. It has hatched! Rania no longer had to protect the nest. But she still had to keep Ma and the chick safe. The chick cant fly yet, said Saleem mamu. So we have to help Ma keep it safe from predators. The little godavan chick followed her Ma everywhere. Rania often saw them in the mung field and the grassland. Thik-thik-thik They ate insects and grass seeds. Rania once saw a pack of dogs enter the field. She yelled for Saleem Mamu and together they chased the dogs away. Uff, thought Rania. Keeping our godavans safe is a lot of work. I cant wait till our chick can fly away from danger! The godavan chick was getting bigger and bigger. She could now fly and was almost as tall as her Ma. Sometimes, Saleem Mamu had trouble telling them apart. But Rania always knew which was which. One day, Saleem Mamu took Rania to the edge of the field. She saw towering windmills and electric wires running from pole to pole. The birds will soon fly away to find new feeding grounds, he said. But they fly so low that they might collide with the wires. Surely the godavans are more important than electric wires? thought Rania. She didnt know how to protect the godavans from the wires. But Saleem Mamu found a solution! The next week, he called some men. They worked for days, placing wires underground and attaching bright mirrors to the wires over ground. The mirrors will reflect sunlight. The godavans will see the flash and know to fly higher, explained Saleem Mamu. Rania was helping Abba in the field when she saw the godavans. The two birds took a short run up and began to flap their heavy wings. Slowly, slowly they lifted off the ground and flew safely over the wires. Fly safe, my godavan birds, yelled Rania. And come back soon. Meet the Godavan The Great Indian Bustard was almost declared Indias national bird! This beautiful species lives in grasslands. The female nests on open ground and lays just one clutch of eggs every year. It is a very tall and heavy bird. Great Indian Bustards fly low and close to the ground. They have weak frontal vision, which means they can't always spot power lines in time to fly over them. The Great Indian Bustard was once found in many parts of India, but today the only viable populations are in Rajasthan and Gujarat. The threats faced by Ranias godavan are real. Fewer than 150 Great Indian Bustards survive in the wild, making them critically endangered. Fortunately, conservationists in India are working to breed them in captivity, so that they never go extinct. These birds can then be released back into the wild, so long as we keep their grasslands safe.""}"

Who is coming? I hope all the Polygons will be there. I miss my cousins, said Khosi. I miss my side of the family the most, the Quadrilaterals, smiled Mom. Yes, its a long time since we saw Rectangle, Square, and Rhombus, said Dad Polygon. Dont forget, they have three children now! Mom reminded Dad. What about cousin Scalene and her children? Are they coming? asked Vusi. Mom answered, Yes, they are Polygons, although they are not Quadrilaterals. Their surname is Triangle. The kids are Isosceles and Equilateral. Oh yes, the Triangle family! exclaimed Vusi. But they look a lot like the Quadrilaterals. No, not exactly, said Mom. Triangles have three sides, while the Quadrilaterals have four sides, like me. Dad Polygon added, I am excited because my three other cousins will be here, they are Pentagon, Hexagon and Octagon. They are also part of our Polygon family. Vusi asked, Dad, why we are called Polygons? We are called polygons because we are 2-dimensional shapes. We are made of straight lines, and our shape is closed, as you can see, all our lines join up. Our cousins the Triangles, the Quadrilaterals, the Hexagons and the Pentagons will all be visiting, replied Dad. Did you say that is Octagon coming? Is she also our relative? asked Khosi. Of course my daughter, by just looking at her you can see she belongs to our family. You need to look carefully at the number of sides your cousins have, otherwise you might not be able to see the difference. Cousin Octagon has eight sides because her name starts with Octa, said Dad. Okay, what about Pentagon and Hexagon? asked Vusi. Cousin Hexagon has six sides because his name starts with Hexa, replied Dad. Pentagons have five sides. Our teacher told us that Penta means five, added Khosi. And remember that Tri means three and Quad means four. Thats what makes your Triangle and Quadrilateral cousins look different, said Mom. Dad, how many sides does Heptagon have? asked Vusi. Dad laughed and said, I am not going to tell you. Remember we took a photograph with them at your uncle's wedding. I want you to look at the photograph carefully and tell me what you observe. Vusi looked at the photograph and quickly answered, Heptagon has seven sides! Khosi added, Yes, remember our teacher told us that Hepta means seven. Oh my wife, can you see how clever our children are? Okay, what about Deca, what does it mean? questioned Dad. Ten! Ten! shouted Vusi and Khosi together. Yes, that's why one of your cousins is called Decagon, but he is not coming because he has to represent the swimming team. There are so few Decagons at their school, Mom told them. Then the children asked, Mom and Dad, can we invite our friend Circle from next door? Their parents agreed that Circle was welcome to join the family gathering. Just then they heard a knock at the front door, and Dad got up to check. The Quadrilaterals are here! Welcome! Welcome called Dad. The rest of the family jump up to greet Square, Rectangle and the three Rhombus children. The Quadrilaterals are happy to arrive first. The Triangle family knock on the door soon after the Quadrilaterals. Scalene, Isosceles and Equilateral are tired after their long journey, but they are so pleased to be with the rest of the family. Finally, Octagon and Heptagon arrive with their children, two Pentagons and Hexagon. They have also brought three Squares with them. Octagon explained, I hope you dont mind that three Quadrilateral children from the village have come with us. They have never visited the city before. Friends and family are always welcome here, smiled Mom. Then she sent all the children outside to play. What game are we going to play? Vusi asked the other children. Equilateral squealed, Let's play the tessellation game! All the Polygon children started to tessellate. Can I play with you? I also want to tessellate, said Circle. Vusi said, Shame, Im sorry you can't tessellate my friend. One of the Squares added, Cant you see your shape, you are not a Polygon. Circles can't tessellate. Circle was sad and felt left out. It's not so much fun playing together when someone is left out. Vusi said, Hey guys, let's rather play a game that Circle can also play. So the Polygons and Circle played happily together until the delicious food was ready.""}"

Something no one had ever built before. Bigger than anything anyone had ever seen, or would ever see. It was to be a tomb fit for a king. A Pharaoh of Egypt. His body had to be preserved for eternity after his death because the ancient Egyptians believed that would help him pass safely through the afterlife. So they had to build a tomb that would last forever. The architects racked their brains for the perfect building plan. It had to be faultless. They couldnt just build something as tall as 30 giraffes piled one on top of the other and wait to see if it stood. They looked to mathematics for the perfect plan. First things first what shape should it be? Nothing fancy, and definitely not like a giraffe! Draw a cube and a pyramid, both with the same v olume. The pyramid is almost three times taller! Cube with side a 2 cm Volume a 3 8 cm 3 This definitely looks more impressive, while using the same amount of building material. So, the architects decided, a pyramid it would be! Pyramid with same base as the square but three times the height, that is, a 2 cm h 6 cm Volume a 2 h3 8 cm 3 First, they built a firm, square base to create a solid foundation. They built this layer with massive limestone and granite blocks, each one the size of a truck. Then they put another layer of blocks on top of this, but slightly smaller in area. On top of this went another square, still smaller until smaller and smaller squares stacked on top of each other created a pyramid. The final piece at the top, a little pyramid by itself, sat elegantly, supported by the mathematically sound structure beneath it. Seven hundred years ago, Egypt was rocked by a powerful earthquake. Most of the newer buildings fell, but the pyramids stood strong. They are still standing strong. But would this tomb be strong enough to last forever? And then making some smaller triangles along the sides. A fractal is made by starting with a simple geometric shape, like a triangle. Over in another part of the world, southern Karnataka, a group of 11th-century Hoysala chieftains wanted to leave their mark on the world. They were not yet emperors, but growing stronger, and they wanted to show their expanding power. So, what else expands? A fractal geometric shape! And then some more little triangles on the sides of the smaller triangles. And then some more, making the design quite complex. A fractal expands outwards from a central point, becoming more detailed and intricate as it grows. Perhaps this is what the Hoysala architects had in mind when they built their temples on platforms to create an effect of movement and grandeur. Like the Kedareshwara temple at Halebidu, built on a staggered square platform. The temple also follows a s taggered pattern within t he platform boundaries, creating a dramatic effect. The architects got more c reative and played with different shapes. Like the s tar-shaped base of the Chennakeshava temple a t Somnathpura. Six hundred years after the Hoysalas, another architect used mathematics to create the effect of grandeur. Francesco Borromini had to build the 'ideal Italian corridor', measuring 99 feet long with a life-sized statue at the end, in the Palazzo Spada in Rome, Italy. But there was a problem. He only had 26 feet of space. So he used a technique called 'forced perspective'. He built pillars close to each other, and made them smaller and smaller in size as he moved towards the end of the corridor. He created a gentle slope for the floor. At the end of the corridor, he placed a child-sized statue. All these mathematical tricks combined to make the corridor look almost four times as long, and make the statue at the end appear double the size! Speaking of size, what would it be like to walk around inside a mathematical instrument that is as big as a house? This is exactly what the Rajput king Sawai Jai Singh built 300 years ago. Sawai Jai Singh, apart from being a ruler, was an astronomer and mathematician. He would calculate the movement of stars and planets using small brass instruments. But he was not very happy because they were not as precise and accurate as he wanted. To get better readings, he decided to make the instruments bigger than anyone had ever imagined! He built 19 structures that measure and predict the movement and position of the Sun, stars and planets. He also built the worlds largest sundial, standing 73 feet tall and 9 feet wide. This can be seen at the Jantar Mantar in Jaipur. For thousands of years, architects have used m athematics to create monuments that are really s trong. But thats not all. Architects have used the concept of symmetry to design some of the most beautiful buildings in the world! The walls of the Keshava Temple in Somnathpur, Karnataka, are covered with intricate carvings that are like mirror images. Every part of the Taj Mahal is symmetrical. The building itself... Its reflection in the clear pool of water... The line of fountains bisecting the reflection... The gardens on either side of the structure... The patterns on the walls... The tiles on t he floor... Down to the last drain hole. Angkor Wat in Cambodia is the largest religious c omplex in the world. It is also symmetrical. The Mayan architects built the pyramid of Chichen I tza, Mexico, with symmetrical precision. Its not just the main structure of the Brihadeshwara Temple in Tamil Nadu that is symmetrical... The designs carved on the vimana are symmetrical, too. When architects use mathematics in their designs, what do we get? Strength, grandeur, beauty and illusion! Like mathematics, these designs never grow old. The buildings built from these designs have stood for centuries and can still be seen today.""}"

Some feel too ripe and some unripe. Do they have anything in common? Yes, they all take up space and have weight. Even the air we breathe. Anything that occupies space and has weight is called matter. Almost everything around us is matter. Matter can be found in three states solid, liquid and gas. Carrots, brinjals, the glass and the cup are solids. They have a definite shape and take up a fixed amount of space. The watermelon juice in the glass and the chai in the cup are both liquids. They do not have a definite shape. They take the shape of the glass and the cup. They can be poured. They flow. But they also take up a fixed amount of space. The air we breathe is a gas. Gases have no definite shape and do not take up a fixed amount of space. Unlike a liquid, air can be squeezed into a tiny space or expand to fill a large space. All matter is made up of tiny particles. In a solid, these particles are packed very tightly together, which gives a carrot or a cup its fixed shape and size. In a liquid, the particles are packed loosely and can move about easily. That is what allows water, oil, juice and chai to flow smoothly and not have a definite shape. In a gas, the particles move about even more freely. They can be squeezed into a small space or spread out in a large space. This is why gases do not have a fixed shape or size. STATES OF MATTER Most objects are solids, liquids or gases. However, they can change their state from one to the other when there is a change in the surroundings. Water, which is usually a liquid, behaves like a solid when it is put inside a freezer. There are also objects which cannot be strictly called either a solid, liquid or gas. Solids usually have fixed shape and liquids do not. However, a piece of sponge seems to have a fixed shape like most solids do but it can change shape very easily.'}"

That makes it older than the garden, older than the city and even older than dinosaurs! Rocks, like the Lalbagh Rock, are a part of nature just like plants or animals. On beaches, by riverbanks, in forests, on the top of mountains, there are rocks everywhere. Some rocks are small enough to fit into our hands. Some are big enough to climb. rough or smooth Rocks can be hard or soft shiny or dull patterned or plain. Geologists are scientists who study rocks and their secrets. Some of those secrets are in this book. Secret No. 1. ROCKS ARE EVERYWHERE Earths rocky layers Outer core : A hot liquid layer made of iron. Inner core : A heavy and hot solid ball of iron. Mantle : The thickest, solid layer, but parts of it can melt and flow. Crust : A solid layer of rock on which we live. Earth is a rocky planet. Beneath our feet, it is all rock. Rocks are made of a mix of minerals. Even soil and sand are made of powdered rock and other natural materials. Beneath rivers, seas and oceans, it is all rock. Secret No. 2. ROCKS CAN MOVE AND MELT Rocks get pushed underground and pushed out all the time. Sometimes, rocks inside the Earths crust and mantle melt, because of heat and pressure. They become a hot liquid called magma. When magma comes out of the crust through a volcano, it is called lava. Closer to the Earths surface, giant pieces of the crust and uppermost mantle, called tectonic plates, keep moving slowly. When they slip and slide against each other, it causes earthquakes. When they collide, mountains rise up but this happens over thousands of years. Secret No. 3. ROCKS ARE OF THREE KINDS Rocks come in many colours, shapes and sizes. But geologists sort them into three kinds, not by appearance, but by how they are formed. Igneous rocks are formed when magma or lava cools down. Granite , which is used in a lot of buildings, is an igneous rock. Imagine having magma in your kitchen! Sedimentary rocks are formed when small pieces of rocks, minerals, sand, and other materials pile up. Over many years, the sediments get pressed and joined together into new rocks. Piles of sand and other minerals can come together to become sandstone . Small bits of shells, coral and bones pile up in shallow waters to become limestone. Metamorphic rocks are rocks that have two lives. They start off as igneous or sedimentary rocks or even other metamorphic rocks. Then, because of heat, pressure or certain chemical reactions, they change into completely new rocks. Marble starts out as limestone, a sedimentary rock. Because of heat and pressure, limestone becomes marble! It is not easy to find out how old our planet is but rocks can help! At this time, geologists think the Earth is about 4.54 billion years old. Secret No. 4. ROCKS ARE CALENDARS Inside old rocks are traces of ancient animals and plants Secret No. 5. ROCKS HOLD MEMORIES OF ANCIENT LIFE A mammoths footprint A dinosaur s keleton A mollusc c ast A leaf i mpression Such traces are called fossils. Fossils form when dead plants and animals get covered by sand, soil and other natural materials. As these materials get pressed into rocks, the remains stay inside, like in a tight box. Fossils help us understand how life evolved on Earth. Rocks break down and pile up. Some become new rocks. Some melt. They become sand and soil and seabed. But all of this happens very slowly, over millions of years. Secret No. 6. ROCKS ARE ALWAYS CHANGING The Lalbagh rock has changed too. First, it was one kind of rock. Now it's another kind. Sometimes, it was solid. Sometimes, it was molten. It looks like a hill now but, once, it was underground. Melting, moving, changing rocks Rocks underground and under the sea Rocks that come in groups of three Rocks with years of memories inside What other secrets could rocks hide? Where did you find this rock? Is the rock rough or smooth? Is the rock hard? Does it crumble when you press it? Does it have a colour? Or bits of different colours? Does it have stripes or some other pattern? Does the rock sparkle? Does it have layers? Do you know what kind of rock it is? Are there other rocks nearby? Do they look the same? Keep a rock diary Whenever you see a new rock, look at it carefully. You can start collecting rocks too, but make sure you are allowed to take them. Write down the answers to these questions:""}"

It is the tradition of the Uipo tribe that the eldest daughter of the family is the first to cut the harvest. Now it is November and today is Reireidaars day. Paa and Nu have invited Reireidaars uncle and aunties to help with the harvest. Khulpu was right. This years harvest is great, says Paa. Of course, 17 years of being fallow has made Ramdaangs fields fertile again, says Mosyel Uncle. Everyone walks towards Ramdaang, the mountain range. The family elders sing as they walk together The men cut the trees low to the ground. The off shoots will be strong again. The forest will grow strong again. The sky was clear and bright! The fire was great! The woods had dried through and through! Reireidaar listened to the song of the elders. In February, they had all come together to clear the forest. Just before the rains, the elders had burnt the wo ods. As they draw closer to Bun, the field hut, the elders sing even more loudly and merrily. Rereidaar looks around the rice field and spots something on the meimang. Its the biggest pumpkin she has ever seen! Behind the big pumpkin she sees many others. But oh, some of them have holes in them! Aehe, those prickly porcupines must have eaten this, she says. Suddenly, a mongoose runs across the field. Or maybe it was that mongoose! says Reireidaar. She picks up a tree branch and says, I am going to protect you all. These are my vegetables, and this is my kingdom. Lost in protecting her kingdom, she does not hear her name being called. ""Its getting late, says Paa. Let Techa Tenaishim cut the first harvest if we cant find Reireidaar. The sun will soon be over our heads. Techa Tenaishim is Reireidaars eldest cousin. Reireidaar sees the elders forming a circle and realizes that Techa Tenaishim is going to cut the first harvest, instead of her. Nooooooo, cries Reireidaar, taking the sickle from her cousin. Ill do it! I know it is my duty, Nu. Reireidaar cuts a bundle of paddy and hands it to Nu. I have to go now. My kingdom needs me! Uipo and Indigenous Shifting Cultivation With 2,800 members, the Uipo are one of the smallest indigenous communities of Manipur. Since time immemorial, they have practiced Hing Lou, shifting cultivation. Chaa Kathad is the symbolic first cutting of paddy with which the harvest begins and its done by the eldest daughter. Every year, Khulpu, the spiritual leader, picks a mountain range that the whole village then cultivates. They avoid cultivating in the same range for at least 13 years. This gap brings the forest back to life. Shifting Cultivation Through the Year January Preparations begin, such as the sharpening of tools. February Once a range is picked, trees are cut and the wood is left to dry. March Fire lines are made and the dried trees and shrubs are burnt before the rain comes. The ash fertilizes the land. April Unburnt wood is collected and placed in small circles and burnt again. These circles are called meimang. The Bun, a hut with a balcony, is built in the middle of the field. May After the first rain, the grain is sown to bring a good yield. JulyOctober Regular weeding is carried out November Pang, the granary, is built, and the harvest is collected. December The harvest is transported to the home granary, Kei.'}"

The virus was called the novel coronavirus. It made many, many people very sick. Superheroes stood up to save the world then. Some tried to find a cure. Some cared for the sick. And some tried to stop its spread. These superheroes did not wear capes. They did not fly. They did not carry swords or lassos. They wore masks and protective suits. They carried stethoscopes and thermometers. They looked through microscopes and examined lab reports. They could be found in peoples homes, in neighbourhoods, in laboratories, in hospitals. Everywhere. The community health workers started their day early. They went from house to house in villages and cities. They asked people to wash their hands, stay home, wear a mask when they stepped outside, and keep a distance of at least 2 metres from others. When people fell ill, the laboratory technicians and molecular biologists collected samples of body fluids and ran tests. They used laboratory equipment and computer programs to conduct tests and analyse results. They recorded the findings and shared them with doctors. The nurses looked after patients and treated them sometimes at home, sometimes at the hospital. They gave patients medicines, and checked their pulse, temperature and oxygen levels. They helped patients recover. If the virus attacked the lungs, the pulmonologists took care of it. They treated patients with lung disease or respiratory problems. They looked at the medical reports and decided the course of treatment. Virologists and doctors conducted research. They studied the virus. They developed new medicines to treat the sickness, and vaccines to prevent people from falling sick. When the virus first appeared, the epidemiologists conducted investigations. Like detectives, they asked questions. Where did it start? How did it spread? Why does it work so fast? Who is at risk? They tried to figure out how to stop the disease from spreading. Their work can be used to prevent similar outbreaks in the future. When people were scared, worried, confused, angry or exhausted, the psychologists listened and guided them. The psychiatrists gave them medicine for anxiety or sadness. Ambulance drivers took patients to the hospital in their ambulances. Delivery persons carried essential supplies, like food and medicines, to peoples home. Reporters brought information and news from all over the world. Garbage collectors collected the waste in the community. All these superheroes worked long hours. They put their lives at risk to protect people. They always showed up when they were needed. They were everyday superheroes.'}"

There, she could watch her favourite animal, play her favourite game and have her favourite drink, coconut water. She would go as often as she could with her best friend, Umeed. One afternoon, they found Thatha decorating his coconut stall. Thatha, which beach is this? asked Arzu, pointing at a photograph. Its so clean and beautiful! said Umeed. Thatha told them how he grew up on this very beach. He would play barefoot and take naps on the sand without having to worry about pieces of glass or garbage. It was heaven! It pains me that you will never see it like that. The next day in school, Arzu told her entire class about Thathas old photos and stories. She described how beautiful the beach once was. We have to do something! And I have a plan. Everyone wanted to help! Arzu showed them the map she had made. She had drawn the whole beach and divided it into four equal parts or quarters. The plan was to divide themselves into four equal teams. Since there were 16 children in the class, this meant that each team would have four children. Each team would collect and separate garbage from one quarter of the beach. Arzu, maybe each team can also be divided into two equal parts? One half of the team can collect garbage and the other half can separate it, said Dia. Thats a great idea! Arzu replied. Half of four is two. So, two of us will collect and two will separate. Wow, I never thought wed use all this maths class stuff to solve real problems, said Umeed. Why do you think were learning maths? asked Arzu, giggling. On Saturday, which was also Thathas day off, all the children got together at the beach. They divided their tools into four equal parts. Tools Total Quantity One Quarter for Each Team Chapati tongs for picking 8 2 sharp or dirty things Sacks for collecting garbage 16 4 Paper for labelling the sacks 16 4 Pens for writing on the labels 4 1 Hour 1 Hour 2 Hour 3 Hour 4 At sunset, Abu arrived as promised with the garbage truck. He weighed all the sacks before loading them. The children had collected 120kg of garbage! There are 30kg of glass and paper, which can be recycled, he said. 30kg out of 120kg, thats one quarter! said Arzu. That leaves 90kg, which means that three quarters of the garbage is plastic, said Umeed. Yes, said Abu. We will take it and separate it further to see what can be recycled or reused. The rest will go to the landfill. On Sunday morning, everyone arrived early and waited for Thatha. Thathas eyes teared up. This time with happiness. I did not think it was possible! he said. Arzu smiled her biggest smile. Anything is possible, Thatha! All it took was some muscle power... And some maths! Umeed said, laughing. SURPRISE! What are fractions? A fraction represents part of a whole. If we divide the whole into two equal parts, each part is 12 or half. If we divide the whole into four equal parts, each part is 14 or a quarter. Find some fractions with Arzu and Umeed Arzu and Umeed have been monitoring plastic waste in the bins. One week, this is what they found. 1. What fraction of the waste is water bottles? 2.

A world filled with wonders. A world of soaring mountains, of deep oceans. A world teeming with life and joy. It is a world we call home. Here, we reign supreme. We design new technological miracles, we shoot for the stars, we build amazing things. We study the world, the universe. We try to make our lives easier, and easier and easier with new gadgets, that aim to make everything better. Easier, yes. But is it better? Our home is paying a terrible price. Were changing the Earth, killing birds and animals with whom we share this planet, endangering our fellow humans. The world is becoming a desert. Oceans are rising, glaciers are melting, crops are failing. The heat is rising. There is a monster that haunts Earth. It is called climate change. Humans are its creator. This is the story of how we made it. It is a story of how we betrayed our home, Earth. About 12,000 years ago, the Earth entered a new geological epoch called the Holocene. It was paradise. This is when the gigantic sheets of ice that covered much of the northern hemisphere and large parts of the southern hemisphere retreated towards the north and south poles, and the world entered a new era of plenty. New forests grew, and life flourished. The worlds climate became warmer and then stabilised. Ever since then, for about 11,000 years, the Earths climate has been stable and calm. Humans have been around for about 2,00,000 years. But before the Holocene, we never had it this good. In the past 11,000 years, we have thrived. We discovered agriculture, we settled down in villages and towns, we created art, built grand civilizations. The pyramids of Giza, the cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, the Mauryan Empire and the Roman Empire - all happened during the Holocene. This was all possible because of widespread agriculture and trade. We grew crops, we made things, we exchanged them with each other. We grew prosperous. Our ancestors started clearing forests to grow more crops and, slowly, their footprint expanded. Even then, much of Europe, North America and South Asia were covered in thick forests. It all happened very slowly, over thousands of years. The effect of human beings on the environment was still very small. The Earth still had enough resources to replenish what was depleted. But as the centuries went by, we started using up the Earths resources faster and faster. By around 500 years ago, Europes ancient forests were mostly gone, and even in other parts of the world, forests were in retreat. Humans have always used the Earths resources, be it trees, minerals like iron, or animals for domestication and food. We have always wanted the planet to give us more. Then, about 250 years ago, something happened. The Industrial Age, the age of machines, began. Until then, we had mostly used handheld tools for work. As a result, there was only so much damage we could do. But with machines, we could do anything. For the first time, we started using machines, like the power loom and the steam engine, to mass produce goods for trade. We burned fossil fuels like coal and oil to power machines to do our work for us. Every aspect of our lives today comes from the Industrial Revolution. Cars, planes, mobile phones, space flight, computers, it all began 250 years ago. But while this lit the fire of human progress, it also unleashed its dark shadow: climate change. The Earth is very old. Over four billion years old. Life on Earth began more than three billion years ago. How do we know? Because that is when the oldest fossils are from. What are fossils? The planet has been home to a dizzying variety of plants and animals. All trees and creatures, including humans, are primarily made of carbon. As they die, and as continents shift, their remains go back into the earth, where they lie. Over thousands of years they return to forms of carbon: coal, gas, oil. This is how the Earths fossil deposits are created. When we started digging up the coal and oil to burn them and power our machines, we gave rise to fossil fuels. That has been the basis of our modern prosperity. For nearly everything we do, we burn coal and oil. We dig into the bowels of the earth, we mine the coal, we extract the petroleum, we burn it. We live our lives. But we have dug so much and burnt so much, that we have upset the balance of the Holocene. The more coal and oil we burn, the more carbon dioxide we release. This gets stored in the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide traps the suns heat. And the world grows hotter. The world is becoming an oven, and the heat is changing the climate. The Earth is slowly becoming unlivable. It is now 1.2 degrees celsius hotter than two hundred years ago. If we continue like this, by 2050, the world will be 2.4 degrees celsius hotter. If that happens then the sea level will rise. Cities like Mumbai and Kolkata might be deserted. Himalayan glaciers will start vanishing, rivers like the Ganga and Brahmaputra will be flooding all the time. And when the glaciers vanish, the rivers will dry up. Heatwaves will make it impossible to go out during the day. Even indoors, people will suffer. Supercyclones will rise out of the sea and hit India every year. Drinking water will be harder and harder to get. The Arctic Circle and Greenland will lose all their ice. Forests will burn every year. From the deepest jungles to the highest mountains, animals will starve. Epidemics and pandemics like COVID-19 might become more common. It is a scary future for the whole world. Yet, there is hope. We dont need to keep burning coal and oil. In fact, the whole world can stop burning fossil fuels by 2050. No fossil fuels. No extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. No more heat. Humans are smart, and we have already built technologies which can draw energy from the sun, wind and water. If every country around the world says NO to fossil fuels, we can defeat the climate change monster. We live in a beautiful world. We can preserve this beautiful Earth, filled with wonders. A world of soaring mountains, of deep oceans. A world teeming with life and joy. It is a world we call home.'}"

Touch the trunk, listen to the rustling leaves, and lie down under the tree to watch the branches sway. There are stories hidden everywhere In the fold of a leaf. In the soft petal on which a beetle slips. In the fruit that a bird bites into. In the bark where a mantis hides in plain sight. But leaves fall. Flowers turn into fruit. Fruit is eaten. Bark peels away. What lives on, is the trunk of the tree. And in the centre of the trunk, near the heartwood, is where trees store their memories. Memories of A cold winter 36 years ago A harsh summer 62 years ago A thunderstorm 108 years ago A drought 116 years ago A forest fire 246 years ago Trees are the original historians. By storing memories around their heartwood, they give us a glimpse of events of the past, to a time before there were human historians. To understand these stories, it is essential to know the language of trees a language that scientists have been working to understand. Like all living beings, trees are made up of cells. Plant cells have a short life and grow constantly. This is why leaves grow and fall and new ones grow in turn. This way, trees continue to grow in height or girth as long as they are alive. Trees live longer than most other living beings! A Bristlecone Pine tree in the White Mountains, USA, has been growing for about 4,850 years. An Alerce tree in the Andes Mountains, Chile, is over 3,600 years old. A Giant Sequoia tree in Sequoia National Park, USA, is 2,700 years old. A Sacred Fig tree in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, is the oldest known human-planted tree, at 2,300 years. The only way to tell the age of a tree is to peek into the trunk. Heartwood : Inactive cells that provide structural support to the tree Sapwood : Soft wood with tissues that transport nutrients and water Cambium : The active growing layer of the tree Bark : The hard outer layer that protects the tree Every year, new wood cells grow in the cambium layer. In regions where there are distinct seasons spring, summer and winter the cells are light during spring, and darker during summer. In winter, the cells dont grow at all. The cells grow in circles, creating a pattern of contrasting rings. The oldest rings are in the centre, and the newest rings are outside, close to the bark. Each ring could mark the passage of a year. In tropical regions, like most of India, where there is rain almost all through the year, tree rings dont have distinct patterns, making it difficult to calculate age. With the right temperature and enough rainfall, the tree stays healthy and grows fast, creating a wide ring. When the summer is too hot, or if there is a drought, tree growth slows down, creating narrow rings. By drilling an increment borer to the heartwood, and extracting a thin long piece of wood, scientists are able to determine the age of a tree. They count the annual rings and read the patterns to understand how old the tree is and how many summers it has lived. Dendrochronology is the study of tree rings to determine the age of a tree. All the trees in a forest will have similar tree ring patterns. So, studying tree rings across a forest helps to understand what an entire landscape has experienced. A mass outbreak of insects that ate up all the leaves or bored into trunks of all trees will cause identical scars in tree rings. Tree rings tell the story of weather conditions and climate change. Climate change is a change in the weather conditions of a particular region, such as temperature and rainfall, over a long period of time. Studying changes in tree ring patterns of old trees over a long time gives an insight into how climate change is affecting the ecosystem. This is called dendroclimatology. When trees in dry, cold climates face a very warm summer, or when trees in warmer climates face a very cold winter, the patterns of tree rings become irregular. Bristlecone Pines have had wider growth rings in the last 60 years than they did in the previous 3,500 years. In Sikkim, India, trees are losing more water through their leaves in summers, affecting their growth. Alpine trees could now be growing higher up than usual in the Tibetan plateau, in search of colder weather. Trees are hardy and many survive forest fires. However, fires cause stress to a tree and this is seen in damaged barks, and scars in the tree rings. Giant Sequoia trees witnessed frequent forest fires before the 19th century, but the fires did not destroy the forest. Now, the fires occur less often, but are more intense and destroy entire forests. Most recorded weather data exists only from the early 19th century. Building a record of past climates helps scientists predict what will happen in the future like how often forest fires will arise in a region, at what temperature ranges droughts occur, and how heavy rainfall will be. Sadly, humans have interfered a lot with the natural world. Weather calamities are occurring more often, and more fiercely. Historical climate records cannot be relied upon for accurate predictions anymore. But the solutions to all these problems continue to lie with trees they give us a way to learn from the past and a path ahead to look into the future. Trees are keepers of memories of the planets ecology and help trace human activity. They store an entire era in a few wood cells. Every layer of the trees trunk unravels a chapter in the history of the Earth.'}"

About beasts that are extinct. Early humans. Places that were once cold but are now warm. Forests that have become deserts. Fossils are remains of plants and animals. Some may have turned to stone with time, while others have remained preserved with flesh and bone under ice or in tree sap. Fossils are rare because they have to survive climatic changes over thousands of years. In 1828, British explorer William Sleeman discovered the first dinosaur fossil in our country, in the Narmada valley. The fossil was named Titanosaurus in 1877 by Richard Lydekker, a British naturalist and geologist. Fossils can be of many kinds. The most common fossils are replicas of animals or plant remains. They are created when dead plants or animals are thrust under water. When this happens, the soft parts rot. But the hard parts, like bones, teeth and shells are remain. Soil, mud and pebbles pile on it and form a cocoon. Over time, even the bones, shells, and teeth dissolve leaving gaps. But minerals in the water fill these gaps and create replicas. These are body fossils. Body fossils have been found across the country. In eastern Gujarat, scientist Dhananjay Mohabey dug out a body fossil of a snake devouring a dinosaur hatchling. In Madhya Pradesh, Vishal Verma, a school teacher discovered hundreds of dinosaur-egg fossils along the Narmada river. In Tamil Nadu, Fossil Subramanian collected fossils of ammonites. Ammonites are ancient soft-bodied molluscs that are survived by their spiral shells, some of which are the size of truck wheels. Sometimes, fossils can also be an entire animal or plant, or part of an organism, trapped in their natural form and preserved for millions of years. These are called true form fossils. Palaeontologist Ashok Sahni and his team discovered spiders and insects in the sticky amber sap in the coal mines of Vastan in Gujarat. Trace fossils are insect burrows, footprints or even poop. Scientist Vandana Prasad found traces of rice pollen in fossilised dinosaur dung from Maharashtra. Thats how they discovered that some dinosaurs had chewed on rice grains. Tiny fossils are called microfossils, like the remains of the 1-mm thick prokaryotessingle-celled primitive organismsunearthed in Madhya Pradesh. When the bones and teeth of fossils are visible to the naked eye, they are called macrofossils. Some macrofossils can be gigantic, like the 18-foot Ichthyosaur, an aquatic reptile whose skeleton was found by palaeontologist Guntupalli V R Prasad and his team in Gujarat. Then there are living fossils. These are species that lived millions or even hundreds of millions of years ago and exist even today. The ten-legged, blue-blooded horseshoe crabs found in the mangroves of the Sunderbans in West Bengal are living fossils. They are early relatives of spiders, and in danger of extinction. They predate dinosaurs by about 200 million years.

Aiyyooo! So frustrating, she thought. Beep-Beep Beep Grrrrr Grrrrr Grrrrr Brrrrr Brrrrr Brrrrr She missed Paatis garden. The garden had birds. Trees. Plants. Grass. Best of all, the garden had... Treeni, her best friend. Treenis branches were like arms, on which she climbed and played and slept. Jaishree called her father. Daddy, I am going to study plants. Humphh! Daddy was an engineer and didnt like it. I can convince him later, Jaishree thought. She moved to a college to study plants. And study she did. She finished two degrees in five years. But there are SO MANY questions that I do not have answers to. Do plants listen to each other? Do plants talk to each other? Do they fight? Can they be friends with each other, like Treeni was mine? Jaishree went many places in search of answers. From New Delhi she went to New York and back to New Delhi. Sadly, the answers were nowhere to be found. Until she went to France. That was where she heard a story. A lonely mustard plant could not grow properly under stress. It was small, sick and sad when the temperature was too high or too low, or when the light was too bright or too dim, or when the soil was too sandy. But when the mustard plant had a friend nearby another mustard plant they both grew tall, green and happy. The mustard plants were helping each other! Alone, they were weak. Together, strong. They helped each other, like Treeni helped little birds and squirrels. They protected each other, like Treeni protected younger plants from harsh sunlight. But Jaishree still had more questions than answers! Why do plants help each other? How do plants help each other? Jaishree thought and thought and thought. She read and read and read. She spoke to people, helpful and unhelpful, but NOBODY had answers. Luckily for Jaishree, mustard plants were fun to work with. Growing them was not difficult, and she needed only one simple tool. A paperclip! Jaishree used a paperclip to sow 4,000 tiny seeds, one at a time. She did this whole exercise many, many, many times. But she didnt get all the answers all the time. She failed and failed and failed. She failed 21 TIMES! Jaishree had more worries. Humans are not always as helpful as mustard plants. She was often told wrong and unkind things. Women cannot do science. Indians cannot do science. STOP BUGGING ME, Jaishree thought. And she carried on with her work. Finally, Jaishree succeeded. Oh yes, I have found it! She found that plants helped each other all the time. She found that some mustard plants helped only similar mustard plants. Other mustard plants helped mustard plants that were not so similar. As Jaishree knew, exciting answers always lead to more questions! Thats curious. Why would some plants do one thing and others do something else? Why cant all plants help each other in the same way? She found that plants which grew with strangers learnt to help those strangers. This behaviour is shaped over many many years by another curious thing called evolution. Jaishree thought, Imagine if we could find out which seeds to grow together so that they help each other. Wouldnt that be fantastic? We could produce so many seeds in so little time with much less money! But what seeds grow together? How should they be grown? Then, there are other questions too. Are plants smart? How smart are they? Jaishree is on a journey to find these answers. In the meanwhile, she learns every day from her helpful plants. If only humans helped each other more, the world would be such a wonderful place! What did YOU learn from plants today? Do you know H Jaishree Subrahmaniam? Dr H Jaishree Subrahmaniam has loved plants since her childhood in New Delhi. She quit an engineering degree to study botany. In 2017, Jaishree started her PhD in France. Her research focused on altruism in plants. Using mustard plants (Arabidopsis thaliana), Jaishree discovered that plants help each other grow better in times of stress. Her research also explained that plants that have grown around strangers for millions of years have learnt to extend help to them, while other plants only help plants that are similar to them. In 2021, Jaishree was selected for the prestigious Marie Curie Fellowship (named after a very important woman scientist) to pursue her postdoctoral research. She will attempt to find out whether plants can be considered intelligent or smart. This journey, however, was not easy. Jaishree had to face racism and sexism many times at work, but her undeterred motivation kept her going. She is actively involved in taking science outside laboratories to anyone and everyone. She is also a social worker, helping create an equitable and welcoming space in science for women. She believes humans have a lot to learn from plants, especially how to extend help in times of stress without being selfish.'}"

Sahyadri tugged at the plug Achchachi had fixed to her bag. ZAP! Sahyadris Pie Chart All the pieces of cloth in the umbrella come together to form a pie chart.

This time, Appa was upset about his rice crop failing year after year. I told you not to plant that lab-created rice, said Paati. Everyone said it was a high-yielding rice variety. The production was high for the first few years. Then it didnt work, said Appa. Not only did it not work, our soil lost its richness, the groundwater depleted and our crops suffered, said Paati. That Golden Rice ruined our fields. I dont know how to recover from this loss, said Appa. Dont worry! I have real gold for you and my grandchildren, said Paati. Appa left in a huff. Paati! You know Appa is struggling to make ends meet. Why do you keep saying you have gold for us? said Savi. If you really had gold, we wouldnt be in such misery, Paati, said Selvan. One day you will see, Selva. Only then will you understand what real gold is, said Paati, smiling. Paati and Appa shared a bittersweet relationship. But they both cared for each other. When Appa came home from the fields, Paati would give him kaapi and appam. Appa would cook her idlis with par-boiled rice batter, the way she liked them. They even went for morning walks together. That night Paati coughed a lot. Appa sat next to her, giving her medicines. Savi and Selvan massaged her legs. Savi, please bring me the wooden box from the locker in my cupboard, said Paati. Do you have the real gold hidden in the box, Amma? teased Appa. Savi and Selvan giggled. You are right. This box contains real gold. If you spend it wisely, it will relieve you of your misery, said Paati. Paati opened the wooden box. Inside were different rice seeds. They were native varieties of rice that Paati had saved over many years. It even had lesser-known varieties like kattuyanam and garudan samba. Kattuyanam rice is drought-resistant and flood-tolerant. Garudan samba has great health benefits. Appa couldnt believe his eyes. He hugged Paati and cried. This is real gold, Amma. You are right. Appa, why did Paati say this rice is gold? asked Savi. One day we will see. And we will understand what she meant, said Appa. Several months passed. Appas fields flourished with Paatis rice. Many of Appas friends came to him looking for help and advice. Appa helped them the same way Paati had helped him. He gave them 2 kg of rice each with a promise that they would return 4 kg from their yield. He used their portions for further distribution among farmers in his village. Those farmers did the same. This chain continued and expanded. Soon, the whole village was thriving with many varieties of indigenous rice. Everyone had enough to eat and enough to sell. Appa, Selvan and Savi enjoyed evening kaapi and red rice appams with Paati. They looked at their golden, ripe paddy fields with pride. They had understood what Paati meant. This was real gold. Know Your Rice The rice you eat at home comes in many different varieties, like basmati, sona masoori or kolam. Both kattuyanam and garudan samba are from Tamil Nadu. Kattuyanam is a red rice and is also called the forest elephant rice. It grows so tall that it can hide an elephant. It helps to hold floods and fertilises the soil. Garudan samba is a brown rice. It is rich in nutrients and fibre. It is best used for making the dish, puttu.'}"

A fraction is made up of two parts: It is denoted by using symbol, such as xy where x denotes the numerator and y the denominator. Example: 35, 815, 12 Decimals are numbers that are made up of a whole number and the fractional part, separated by a dot called a decimal point For example, 16.3 is a decimal. To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator Example: 35 as a decimal is 3 5 0.6 65100 as a decimal is 65 100 0.65 48 as a decimal can be simplified as 1 2 0.5 55 45 35 25 15 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2'}"

They had tried coal, wood and oil as fuel but they were of little help. The Dordles needed to find a better fuel to take them home. Fuel like coal took millions of years to form. There was very little coal left on Earth. So the Dordles went looking for fuel that was there in plenty and would never run out. Dordle B set sail for the seas looking for energy sources. Along the way, he found: Rivers Dams Tides Waterfalls Dordle D took to the skies and realised that she could harness the energy of the wind and use it to power their ship. Dordle E packed his bags and said goodbye to the others. He would travel to the Sun and steal its fire. Sadly he didnt make it all the way to the Sun, but did find a way to use its energy. The Dordles found all sorts of new sources of energy. Like geothermal energy, using the heat from under the earth. And nuclear energy, which they got by splitting very small particles called atoms. They built devices that helped them better harness energy. After months of trying, the Dordles finally had the energy they needed. They turned on their engines, fastened their seatbelts, lifted off, and zoomed away from Earth. What Is Renewable Fuel? Renewable energy is collected from renewable sources in nature. Sunlight, wind, rain, waves and geothermal energy (heat from the ground) are always around us, regardless of how much we use them. Biofuel is made from agricultural, industrial and domestic waste. We can harness energy from these sources and use it to power our houses, vehicles and factories. Energy from these sources is less polluting. What Is Nuclear Fuel? Nuclear fuels are used in power plants to generate heat and electricity. Heat is created when the nuclear fuel undergoes nuclear fission. This is where an atom with a large nucleus is split into two or more atoms with smaller nuclei. The nuclear fission reaction produces a lot of heat, which is then used to generate electricity. Nuclear energy is not renewable since the nuclear fuel has to be mined.'}"

Dordle D, the smartest of the three, trekked to the densest forest. But she was shocked to see just one tree. Dordle D had to settle for a few dry branches. Dordle E, the tiniest Dordle, sailed to the oil fields that never dried up. Dordle E was lucky to leave with a few drops of oil. The Dordles gathered their fuel, and put it into their ship to burn and generate energy. The engines roared, the lights came alive, the ship lifted off. But sadly they didnt get very far. Disappointed, the Dordles did what Dordles do best. They ate till their tummies reached their chest. What Is Fuel? A fuel is a substance that releases useful energy when it undergoes a chemical reaction. Materials such as coal, wood, oil and gas provide us with heat, light and energy when they are burned. Energy can be used to cook our food, keep us warm and make our engines run. Fuels come in different forms. They can be solids like wood and coal, liquids like petrol and kerosene, or gases like Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) and biogas. We use fuel to drive cars, generate electricity for homes and power factories.'}"

Dordle B, the oldest Dordle, left to get firewood. He only used fallen branches, and planted more trees when he was done. Dordle D, the brightest Dordle, turned off all the lights on the ship to save energy. While Dordle E, the youngest Dordle, buried a bone he found, with the hope of it turning into coal. The Dordles looked for other ways to save fuel. They replaced things that were broken and things that used too much energy. They cycled and walked when they searched for fuel. They even found bio-waste and turned it into biofuel. The Dordles had collected more fuel than before. They were sure that they would be able to leave the planet this time. They started their engines, put on their seatbelts, and their ship zoomed into the sky. Tired and hungry, the Dordles knew what to do next. They ate till their tummies touched their necks. This time, the Dordles got far, but not far enough. What Are Fossil Fuels? Fossil fuels are fuels that were formed from the buried remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. They are found naturally under the earth, and are the most-used fuels in the world. Fuels such as coal, crude oil and natural gas are all considered fossil fuels because they originally came from fossils. Fossil fuels are limited in quantity, because it takes millions of years to make them. They are also bad for the environment. Burning fossil fuels produces too much carbon dioxide. This leads to global warming and the melting of the ice caps, causing the oceans to rise and climate change to speed up. Luckily, just like the Dordles, the world is looking to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and switch to fuels that are clean and safe for the environment.'}"

Colourful birds wake me with their chirping when the sun rises in the east. I also think I hear bears growling in the west when it gets dark. But Amma says thats just Appa snoring. I would love to meet a bear and give it a hug. With love from your best friend, Shaana August 27, 2019 Hi everyone, Did you know that Arunachal Pradesh is far away from Himachal Pradesh? Himachal is in the north but Arunachal is all the way in the east. I thought all the Pradesh states sat next to each other. We took two trains and drove a long time to get here. This morning, we walked through a forest to reach our treehouse. The forest here is so thick that if you blink or stop to tie your shoelaces, you will get lost. I love Arunachal the best so far and am beginning to enjoy myself. I hope we get to see red pandas.

Today, Amma and Appa took me out onto the river in a small boat. Amma tells me that places like the Sundarbans are called wetlands. I never knew such a place existed, and that it was possible for trees called mangroves to grow in seawater! But Amma is sad about how much this place floods today. We also saw crocodiles and a lonely snake while boating. I hope they dont follow us home. How is everyone? Are you missing me yet?

Love, Shaana October 1, 2019 Dear class, Today was the best day ever! We drove east from the desert to the Narmada river, which flows all the way to the centre of India, and it only took us six hours. In the afternoon, Amma, Appa and I went rafting in the river and you wont believe how wild and scary it was. I always thought rivers were calm, but up close theyre really fast . Appa says that there used to be a lot more water, and rafting was much scarier then. I was fully wet by the time I was done, and Appa was so scared that he swore never to go rafting ever again. I love the water so much and cant wait to go back. Your best friend, Shaana October 20, 2019 Dear classmates, Amma and Appa are fast asleep, and I should be sleeping too, but I just love looking out the window. I think were in the southwest part of the country, in Goa, and you wont believe how nice the plateaus look. There are so many hills here, and beaches too. There are also a lot of tunnels that the train goes through. I used to be afraid of tunnels, but Im not any more. Someday, I wish we could all go on a tour of the plateaus. Maybe when were in class 11 . Love, Shaana November 1, 2019 Dear friends, I cant believe were in the same state again! We travelled south, and I will be home soon. We reached Chennai yesterday, and on the way to Puducherry, we decided to learn how to surf. I think Im good at it now because I only fell down twice. Amma and Appa splashed water on each other and behaved like children. Its a good thing I was there to control them. The beaches here are not like the ones we have on our island. The waves are a lot rougher and the water is browner, but I still like it here. Your best friend, Shaana November 21, 2019 Hi everyone, I just crossed the Pamban bridge. I could see the ocean on both sides. How amazing that a train can travel across the sea like this! Im almost home, and I cant wait to give you my final letter in person. Love, Shaana November 23, 2019 Dear classmates, I thought Amma and Appa would be tired from all our travelling, but we made one last stop at the Olaikaadu beach before we reached home. And Im so happy we did. Amma wanted to teach me how to dive, but they did not have diving suits my size, so I spent the day floating and looking at the fish while my parents dove below me. We found all sorts of pebbles on the beach, and I cant wait to give them to you in person tomorrow. Your best friend, Shaana December 1, 2019 Dear Amma and Appa, I cant believe we travelled across the whole country! I know were going to miss visiting the forests, glaciers, deserts, wetlands, plateaus and mountains. And we are going to miss hearing all those new languages and meeting all those different people. But were finally home now, and we can join our friends again. I hope we get to travel like this again, and maybe next time we can take our friends with us. With love, Shaana Map is not to scale and only for the sake of representation'}"

While the rest of her classmates were asleep, four-year-old Mohana watched an army of ants marching in a row. Mohana gently picked up the ants in her palm, and discovered they have a distinct odour, an unpleasant one. She often watched the praying mantis sitting on the wall, move its foreleg from side to side, waiting for its prey. She carried green grasshoppers on the back of her palm when they accidentally hopped indoors. On rainy days, she squatted by the swarms of termites on the floor and felt their wings with her fingertips. She watched as their wings fell off and the insects walked away, untroubled. Mohana longed to become a scientist who studies insects. Years later, she studied zoology, joined the Zoological Survey of India and became an entomologist pursuing taxonomy. An entomologist studies insects. Some entomologists study insect taxonomy. They identify and organise different species of insects by shape, by size, by pattern and even the way they develop over time. Mohanas job took her to the deepest jungles. No one had seen women travel to far-flung remote areas for forest surveys, but Mohana had become an entomologist to discover unusual species of insects. On her first forest survey, she wore flimsy shoes, which gave way, and she had to walk through the forest, barefoot. This taught her never to step out without a pair of good field shoes. It was twilight in the Wayanad hills when Mohana saw a banyan tree sparkling as though lit up by stars. As she tiptoed near it, she spotted thousands of fireflies. Deep in the Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary in Kannur, she came across a resting population of migrating milkweed butterflies. There were also thousands of blue tiger butterflies on low branches of a tree. Sensing movement, all the butterflies set to flight as one, as Mohana gasped in wonder. Mohanas work drove her to study the tiny wasps that belonged to the Hymenoptera insect family. The wasps were so minuscule that they couldnt be identified without a microscope, but they played an important role in maintaining balance in the ecosystem. She studied their habits, published research papers on them and discovered over 150 new species. Mohana even had a species named after her, Dipara mohanae . From wasps to termites, the more species Mohana found, the more she wanted to discover. Insects are pollinators, pests, soil engineers and more they influence human lives in many ways. Being an entomologist, Rajmohana Keloth knows and appreciates this every day. Get to know Mohana May 9, 1971: Rajmohana Keloths birthday. 1975: Mohanas first memory of observing insects. 1993: Mohana completes her post graduation in zoology specialising as an entomologist. 1994: She gets her dream job and joins the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) as a junior research fellow. 1996: Discovers four unknown species of insects and has her first new species publication. 1999: Gets her PhD degree and joins postdoctoral research. 2004: Rejoins the Zoological Survey of India as a scientist and has worked there ever since.

Hippos sharpen their teeth by constantly grinding them together. Tigers have stout teeth so that they can hold their prey in place. Cobras have modified teeth called fangs. They use their sharp, hollow fangs to inject venom into their prey. A Narwhals tooth looks like a long horn. It is believed to be used for exchanging information about the conditions of the water they are in. Sharks jagged teeth are a combination of pointed lower teeth and triangular upper teeth, useful for cutting into prey. Beaver teeth have a coating of iron, which makes them orange and also very strong. Squirrels have teeth that never stop growing. This helps them because they gnaw constantly. The Crab-eater Seal has specially modified teeth to strain the small krill, which are its food. Parrotfish have about a thousand teeth, cemented together in rows, to form a beak with which they bite into coral.

Kingfishers have long, pointed beaks, which do not disturb the water surface when they dive in to catch fish. Toucans use their colourful beaks to show off their beauty as well as for self-defence. Sparrows cone-shaped beaks are stubby but sharp. They are capable of crushing seeds in a very strong grip. Spoonbills use their long, flat, rounded beaks to search for fish, amphibians and crabs along the bottom of muddy water. Flamingos bent beaks help them filter out very small plankton, tiny fish and fly larvae from shallow, muddy water. Parrots use their hook-like beaks for cracking open hard nuts. Hornbills have unique helmet-like structures on their beaks which help their call travel farther by making the sound boom louder. Sunbirds have long, curved beaks that point downward. They use their beaks to reach nectar, small spiders and insects deep inside flowers. Hummingbirds have very long, thin beaks with which they probe deep into flowers for nectar. Pelicans scoop up fish in their beak pouches. The water drains out, and the fish are swallowed. Puffins can catch and carry a bunch of fish at a time in their beaks.'}"

The hungry myna hopped with excitement. Time to feast on her favourite food the sun. The sun? But how? Isnt it too big? Too hot? Tooooooo far away? The myna had a plan. It started with the plants, who drank up golden sunshine through their leaves. The sunlight, mixed with sweet morning air and cool water, made a delicious meal for the plants. For extra flavour, there were snacks in the soil. A prickly caterpillar crawled out of his egg. He was hungry enough to eat the whole plant! Leaf after leaf after leaf he gobbled, getting bigger and pricklier. The purple leaves were his favourite bitter and juicy with a spicy twist. The caterpillar couldnt eat another bite. He hid under a leaf and wrapped himself up. After much tossing and turning, he was ready to come out as a moth! Nearby, the gecko licked her eyes clean to make sure she was seeing right. Those wings looked so soft! These days, moths find it hard to see the moon and stars at night. So, they gather around light bulbs instead. Hidden in the shadows, the gecko couldnt wait any longer. Her long, sticky tongue flew out of her mouth and caught the moth. The wings melted in her mouth. The bushy antennae tickled her throat on the way down. Delicious! By morning, the gecko had tasted all kinds of wings soft, chewy, and even some mouth-wateringly crisp ones. With each meal, she grew bigger and rounder. Too full to move, the gecko settled in for a nap. The mynas beak dropped open. Those gecko toes looked SO crunchy! Crunchy toes soft wings juicy leaves and plenty of delicious sunshine The myna gobbled up the gecko with a snap of her beak. She saved the tail for last, which wiggled and squiggled delightfully in her stomach. The mynas plan to eat the sun had worked! But she was still hungry... Behind her, the hungry cats whiskers quivered. Time to feast on his favourite food, the sun. The Food Chain Every time you take a bite of food, you are eating the sun! All living beings, including humans, need energy to grow. This energy comes to our bodies through food. Plants feed themselves by turning sunlight into food! They pass the suns energy on to animals, like the caterpillar who chomped up the plants leaves, or like us eating vegetables. Some animals also depend on other animals for energy, like the gecko who ate the moth, or us eating fish curry for dinner. This transfer of energy is called the food chain, and it begins with the sun. Other animals are hungry, too! Spiders love to eat moths, just as cats love to eat geckos, grasshoppers eat plants and birds love to snack on caterpillars. When food chains get all tangled up, the result is a food web. Can you draw a food web from animals you see around you? But where does a food chain, or food web, end? When the last animal in a food chain reaches the end of its life, it becomes food for worms, mushrooms and tiny creatures like bacteria living in the soil. After they are done, plants get the leftovers. Nothing in nature is wasted! Mango tree Castor plant Grasshopper Cocoa Tussock Moth Green Lynx Spider House Gecko Common Myna Cat Human'}"

On clear nights, she can spot faraway stars and planets. But she is most curious about aliens and doesnt tire of looking for them. One night, she sees a very bright spot in the sky. The spot gets bigger and bigger. It comes closer and closer. And it lands in Anvis backyard. Its a spaceship! Two red blobs peep out of the spaceship. Each of the blobs has three eyes, two noses and no hair. Anvi rubs her eyes in disbelief! Are they aliens? The blobs stare and stare at Anvi and then stretch out their hands. Anvi is curious. She walks into the spaceship, as if in a dream. The doors close as soon as she steps in and the spaceship takes off. Anvi peeps out of the window. She cant see her house anymore. Instead, there are huge, scary purple mountains outside. Bump. Thud. Bump! The spaceship seems to have landed. Anvi rushes to open the door. She steps outside and whooooosh... She slips and falls. She shivers. The ground is covered with ice. There are thousands of red blobs marching up and down. Where am I? she asks the blobs. They shrug and look up to the sky. Anvi looks up. She sees a big red sun and two smaller bright dots in the sky. It looks like there are three suns! she exclaims. Again, the blobs dont respond. Once more, Anvi asks her new blob friends, Where am I? This time they shake their heads. Could this be Jupiter? No, it is made of gas. I wouldnt be able to stand on it, she thinks. Could this be the moon of Saturn? she wonders. But no, where are Saturns rings? The next day in school, Anvi runs to her best friend Rukaiyya. I met some aliens last night! she says. They were red blobs. I went with them to their planet in a spaceship. Which planet do you think they were from? Oooo, you lucky thing! I read a book which said there are billions of planets outside our Solar System called exoplanets. The one closest to Earth is Proxima Centauri b. Do you think the blobs came from there? asks Rukkaiya. Yes. Maybe they did. I would love to visit again, says Anvi. Meanwhile, on exoplanet Proxima Centauri b: Two red blobs are sitting on a tower. We went into space yesterday, one says. I think we reached another planet. A strange-looking creature was staring at us. She followed us into the spaceship. I heard theyve discovered a new planet, and named it Earth. Do you think you went there? Planet Proxima Centauri b Proxima Centauri b was discovered in 2016. It revolves around the star Proxima Centauri. Even though it is the closest planet to our Solar System, it is still 4.2 light years or 40 trillion kilometres away from Earth. Light from Proxima Centauri would take about four years to reach us. Did Anvi really go to planet Proxima Centauri b? Even if Anvi had travelled by the fastest spaceship today, it would have taken more than 70,000 years to reach Proxima Centauri b. So, it is unlikely that Anvi reached Proxima Centauri b unless the blobs had a spaceship that goes faster than light! (Scientists think it is impossible to travel faster than light.) Earth Sun Proxima Centauri Alpha Centauri B Alpha Centauri A What were the three dots that Anvi saw in the sky? Proxima Centauri b revolves around the star Proxima Centauri, a small red dwarf star. This star is redder, cooler and doesnt shine as brightly as the Sun. There are two other stars near it Alpha Centauri A and B. If Anvi had reached Proxima Centauri b, she would have seen Proxima Centauri as a big red ball, and the other two further stars as bright white dots. Alpha Centauri B Alpha Centauri A Proxima Centauri Earth Sun Telescopes are magical instruments that can show us the wonders of the universe. The James Webb Space Telescope was launched into space by the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in December 2021. It began capturing stunning images of light emitted by some of the first galaxies born in our universe. The light from the stars in these galaxies was emitted over 13 billion years ago our universe was still very young then. Imagine, the light travelled about 120000000000000000000000km before reaching the James Webb Telescope. NASA shared the images with us Earthlings in July 2022.'}"

Why did her classmates who sat inside not speak or play with them? Why did these upper-caste students inside the classroom live in a certain locality of the village? Sembattai wondered, Are they different from us? she as ked herself. The first time Sembattai saw the inside of her classroom, it was to try on Nagajyotis anklet. She heard its distinct sound and asked, All the other girls get to wear anklets, but I dont. Why? You can! Nagajyoti said. But lets wait for the other students to leave the school. Then well go to the classroom and you can try it out! Sembattai danced and twirled and sang. When her family moved to Thoothukudi , Sembattais father put her in an all-boys school. Everyone thought she was a boy, but she knew she was not. She wondered, Why did she have to wear pants instead of a dress? Why did she have to crop her beautiful brown hair short just because all her classmates did? The boys asked her stran ge questions. W hy do you walk like a girl? Why do you talk like a girl? Why do you only play hopscotch? Because I am a girl , Sembattai thought. Why does nobody understand me? Why must I be like everyone else? She thought and thought and thought. ENOUGH. If her parents, her school and her classmates could not accept her for who she was, she would find people who would. One day, as the sun began to rise, 16-year-old Sembattai left her home. She walked and walked and walked, until she reached Tirunelveli. There she saw a group of women in a shop. They were making halwa. The smell of hot ghee made the rats in Sembattais stomach run faster. Munna Nayak asked her, Why do you look worried? Amma, I have left home, she said. Munnamma gave Sembattai a big hug. Aiyo! Where will you roam around all this while? she said. Why dont you come live with us, Grace? We are Thirunangai transgender women. Just like that, Grace knew who she was. With Munnamma, she could wear sarees, anklets, bindis, anything she wanted she could live her life as herself. When Grace went to sleep at night, she felt loved. One day, Grace spoke to Munnamma. Amma, I want to be a doctor. Munnamma shed a tear of joy. You should study and make us all proud, she said. It was not often that Thirunangais could study. Grace had always wanted to be a doctor. But, she had never finished school. So, she decided to get a diploma in computer science engineering. She knew she had to study harder than everybody else. For one, she had never used a computer before. Also, by now, Grace knew she wasnt just a transgender woman. She was also a Dalit woman someone from a historically oppressed caste. Society still saw her as Dalit and transgender not as somebody who could study and make a life for herself. She had to prove them wrong. After she graduated, Grace got a job making software for computers. But she wanted to study some more. She wanted to pursue electrical and electronic engineering. When she went to fill out the application form, there were only two boxes. What about us Thirunangais? She applied nonetheless. But her application was denied. Thirunangais could not study engineering, it seemed. Hmmph! It was time for a fight. Munnamma encouraged her. My daughter can win any fight. With help from a lawyer named Sanjeev Kumar, Grace asked the university one simple question. Why can transgender persons not study engineering? It left people at the university thinking. They had no response. The victory was Graces. In her mind, there was a larger question looming. Why cant science and technology be accessible to all? While Grace was fighting her own battle, she had adopted Tharika, a young transgender woman. Grace was committed to passing on the love and encouragement she had received from Munnamma. When her daughter went to sleep, she could dream of a beautiful future now. Tharika dreamt of being a doctor, just as Grace once had. It was Tharikas turn to apply to university. The application form still had only two boxes: Male and Female. Grace decided she wouldnt fight just for Tharika. This time, she would fight so that all transgender persons could pursue whatever education they choose, without having to hide their identity. Tharika and Grace filed a case in the Madras High Court. The High Court judgement was clear. T harika and all transgender persons had the right to study medicine, like everyone else. The motherdaughter team had won. So had an entire community. Today Grace continues to fight for the rights of transgender persons and persons from marginalised caste backgrounds to science education and employment. Gone are the times when science was done by upper-caste men alone, she says. As Grace confronts every challenge that society throws at her, Munnammas voice rings in her head. My daughter can win any fight! Meet Grace Banu Grace Banu is an electronics and electrical engineer, and an anti-caste and transgender-rights activist. She was born in 1989 in Pudurpandiyapuram, a village near Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu. Grace has been recognised for her work in making science and technology education accessible to people from marginalised backgrounds. The judiciary has the power to ensure justice for communities who historically have been deprived of equitable access to education and employment. Grace has decided to make the best use of the judiciary to win the rights of transgender persons and people from marginalised-caste backgrounds. She also trains them for entrance examinations for science institutions and universities. Science and technology education must be accessible to all.'}"
